# Data Modeling

## Coverage

Design logical and physical data structures from a validated conceptual model. Covers entities as stored records, identifiers, primary keys, foreign keys, uniqueness, cardinality enforcement, normalization, denormalization, derived data, materialized views, provenance, retention, indexing implications, and schema-change risk.

## Philosophy

Data models are long-lived promises. Application code changes quickly; stored data and integrations remember mistakes. A good data model preserves business meaning, supports expected queries, and prevents invalid states without overfitting to today's UI.

Do not jump from concept to migration. First decide what must be stored, what can be derived, what must be constrained, and what must remain queryable.

## Method

1. Start from a conceptual model or extract one quickly.
2. Define identity and uniqueness for each stored entity.
3. Map relationships to keys, junctions, embeddings, or references.
4. Decide normalization vs denormalization based on write/read patterns and consistency requirements.
5. Mark derived fields and their source of truth.
6. Add provenance for data sourced from external systems or calculations.
7. Check query patterns and indexing implications.
8. Hand off to `database-migration` for implementation changes.

## Evals

This skill ships a comprehension-eval artifact at [`examples/evals/data-modeling.json`](https://github.com/jacob-balslev/skill-graph/blob/main/examples/evals/data-modeling.json). The checklist below is the authoring gate for persistence-model decisions; the eval file is the grader surface.

## Verification

- [ ] Every stored entity has identity and uniqueness criteria
- [ ] Relationship cardinality is enforceable or intentionally documented
- [ ] Derived data names its source and refresh rule
- [ ] Denormalization has a stated read/write tradeoff
- [ ] External-source fields carry provenance
- [ ] Retention and privacy obligations are represented where relevant
- [ ] Expected queries can be served without accidental full scans at scale

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `conceptual-modeling` | You are still discovering business concepts without persistence details. |
| `database-migration` | You need to write, apply, or verify a concrete migration. |
| `ontology-modeling` | You need formal semantic axioms or reasoning constraints. |
| `api-design` | You need endpoint, request, response, error, and versioning design. |
