# React Composition Patterns

## Domain Context

**What is this skill?** This skill provides React composition patterns that scale — compound components, render props, context providers, lifted state, and React 19 API changes. It applies when refactoring components with boolean prop proliferation, designing flexible component APIs, building reusable libraries, or reviewing component architecture — triggered by phrases like "this component has too many props," "design a compound component," "make this more composable," "refactor with render props," or "component API design." Do NOT use for performance optimization — use react-best-practices instead.

## Coverage

React component composition patterns that prevent boolean prop proliferation: compound components (shared context children), explicit variant components, children-over-render-props, context provider state/actions/meta interface, boolean state explosion audit, and the React 19 API migration (no forwardRef, use() over useContext()). Covers the refactor playbook from flag inventory through variant extraction to provider-based composition.

## Philosophy

Boolean props are technical debt that compounds exponentially. Every boolean added to a component doubles the state space, and most of those combined states are impossible or unsupported. Agents default to adding "just one more boolean" because it is the fastest path -- this skill forces the discipline of auditing the state explosion first. Without it, agents regularly create components with 5+ booleans and fragile if/else rendering chains that break on edge-case combinations.

Composition patterns for building flexible, maintainable React components. Avoid
boolean prop proliferation by using compound components, lifting state, and
composing internals. These patterns make codebases easier for both humans and AI
agents to work with as they scale.

## Core Mandate

- Never add boolean props to customize behavior.
- If a component accumulates 3 or more booleans, treat the API as broken until proven otherwise.
- Provider boundaries matter more than visual nesting; the provider owns state, actions, and meta.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Refactoring components with many boolean props
- Building reusable component libraries
- Designing flexible component APIs
- Reviewing component architecture
- Working with compound components or context providers

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category                | Impact | Prefix          |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------ | --------------- |
| 1        | Component Architecture  | HIGH   | `architecture-` |
| 2        | State Management        | MEDIUM | `state-`        |
| 3        | Implementation Patterns | MEDIUM | `patterns-`     |
| 4        | React 19 APIs           | MEDIUM | `react19-`      |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Component Architecture (HIGH)

- `architecture-avoid-boolean-props` - Don't add boolean props to customize
  behavior; use composition
- `architecture-compound-components` - Structure complex components with shared
  context
- `architecture-boolean-state-audit` - Count reachable vs impossible states before adding props

### 2. State Management (MEDIUM)

- `state-decouple-implementation` - Provider is the only place that knows how
  state is managed
- `state-context-interface` - Define generic interface with state, actions, meta
  for dependency injection
- `state-lift-state` - Move state into provider components for sibling access

### 3. Implementation Patterns (MEDIUM)

- `patterns-explicit-variants` - Create explicit variant components instead of
  boolean modes
- `patterns-children-over-render-props` - Use children for composition instead
  of renderX props

### 4. React 19 APIs (MEDIUM)

> **⚠️ React 19+ only.** Skip this section if using React 18 or earlier.

- `react19-no-forwardref` - Don't use `forwardRef`; use `use()` instead of `useContext()`

## How to Use

### Boolean State Explosion Audit

Before adding a new prop or mode, answer:

1. How many booleans does this component already have?
2. How many combined states does that create?
3. Which of those states are impossible, unsupported, or nonsensical?
4. Can the valid states be named as explicit variants instead?

If a boolean produces impossible combinations, stop and refactor the API.

### Refactor Playbook

1. Inventory flags and modes.
2. Enumerate valid combinations.
3. Delete impossible states.
4. Name the remaining variants explicitly.
5. Extract a provider that owns `state`, `actions`, and `meta`.
6. Compose subcomponents around that contract.
7. Add one example or test per valid variant.

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
rules/architecture-avoid-boolean-props.md
rules/state-context-interface.md
```

Each rule file contains:

- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Incorrect code example with explanation
- Correct code example with explanation
- Additional context and references

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] No component has 3+ boolean props without an explicit variant refactor
- [ ] State is lifted into a context provider, not drilled through props
- [ ] Compound components use children composition, not renderX props
- [ ] React 19 code uses ref as regular prop and use() instead of useContext()
- [ ] Impossible state combinations are documented and eliminated

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| React performance optimization (memoization, suspense) | `react-best-practices` | Performance skill owns rendering optimization |
| Visual component design and styling | `visual-design` or `ux-ui-patterns` | This skill covers API shape, not visual appearance |
| Next.js routing and server components | `next-best-practices` | Next.js skill owns framework-level patterns |
