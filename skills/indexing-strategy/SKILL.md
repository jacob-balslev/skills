# Indexing Strategy

## Coverage

The discipline of designing auxiliary data structures that let the database find rows quickly without scanning every row. Covers the structure catalog (B-tree, hash, bitmap, GIN, GiST, BRIN, LSM-tree) and the access patterns each matches, composite indexes and column-order rules, covering indexes and INCLUDE clauses, partial / filtered indexes, expression indexes, the maintenance cost of every index (storage, write amplification, lock impact, planner overhead), and the strategic question of treating the index set as an optimized portfolio rather than a per-column checklist.

## Philosophy

Indexes are a write/read trade. Every index speeds up some queries and slows down every write. The strategic discipline is not "which columns deserve an index" considered in isolation; it is the whole-database trade-off between read speed and write cost, given the workload's actual access patterns.

The wrong default is "add an index for every column ever filtered on." The wrong response to a slow query is always "add an index." The right discipline is to count the queries that would benefit, count the writes that would pay the cost, and check whether the index is actually used by the planner before keeping it.

The structure catalog matters. A B-tree is the right default for the vast majority of access patterns. Specialized structures (GIN for arrays/JSON/full-text, BRIN for naturally-ordered large columns, R-tree/GiST for geospatial) serve specific patterns far better than B-tree. Knowing which structure matches which pattern is the design vocabulary.

## Structure → Access Pattern Matrix

| Pattern | Best structure | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Equality lookup (`col = x`) | B-tree, hash | Both serve; B-tree is more flexible |
| Range (`col BETWEEN x AND y`) | B-tree | Hash doesn't support range |
| Prefix match (`col LIKE 'foo%'`) | B-tree | Range over a prefix |
| Contains (`'foo' = ANY(col)`, JSON contains) | GIN | Inverted index for many-keys-per-row |
| Full-text search | GIN or specialized (Elasticsearch) | Inverted index |
| Geospatial proximity | GiST / R-tree / PostGIS | Spatial structures |
| Range types / `&&` overlap | GiST | Range-aware structure |
| Naturally-ordered append-only (timestamps) | BRIN | Small summary index |
| Write-optimized point-write workload | LSM-tree | Write throughput primary |
| Low-cardinality AND-combination (data warehouse) | Bitmap | AND across columns efficient |
| Low-cardinality high-update workload | None (use partial or skip) | Bitmap updates poorly |

## Composite Index Column Order Rule

For an index on (A, B, C), the index serves queries with leading-column prefixes:

| Query | Uses index? |
|---|---|
| `WHERE A = x` | Yes |
| `WHERE A = x AND B = y` | Yes |
| `WHERE A = x AND B = y AND C = z` | Yes |
| `WHERE A = x AND C = z` | Yes (A prefix), but skips B in scan |
| `WHERE B = y` | No (no leading A) |
| `WHERE C = z` | No |
| `ORDER BY A, B, C` | Yes (sort avoided) |
| `ORDER BY A DESC, B DESC` | Yes (Postgres can reverse scan) |
| `ORDER BY B` | No |

Column order rule: put the most-selective and most-filtered column first.

## When To Add, Drop, Never Add

| Situation | Decision |
|---|---|
| Query is frequent, slow, and matches no current index | Add an index |
| Query is rare (monthly report); table is otherwise hot | Don't add — query can scan |
| Index exists but is reported as unused by `pg_stat_user_indexes` for 3+ months | Drop it |
| Column has low selectivity (boolean, status enum with two common values) | Use a partial index on the rarer value, or skip |
| Column is part of a composite key with leading columns covered by another index | Skip; the existing index serves |
| Column is a foreign key, joined frequently | Add an index (FK joins are common; the planner uses it) |
| Column is a foreign key, never joined | Optional; some teams add for CASCADE operations |
| Write-heavy table (audit log, event stream) | Minimal indexes — primary key only, occasionally one more |

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] Index structure matches the access pattern (B-tree for ordered queries; GIN for contains; BRIN for naturally-ordered large columns; etc.). Default B-tree everywhere is not necessarily correct.
- [ ] Composite indexes have intentional column order. Most-selective and most-filtered column first.
- [ ] Index usage is monitored (`pg_stat_user_indexes` for Postgres, equivalents elsewhere). Unused indexes are dropped on a regular cadence.
- [ ] Write-heavy tables have minimal indexes. The number of indexes is justified against the table's write rate.
- [ ] Partial indexes are used where access patterns target a small subset of rows (e.g., `WHERE status = 'pending'`).
- [ ] Covering indexes (INCLUDE clause or composite with projected columns) are used for read-hot queries where row fetch is the bottleneck.
- [ ] EXPLAIN ANALYZE is used to verify the planner uses the added index. An index that exists but is ignored by the planner is pure cost.
- [ ] Index creation in production uses CONCURRENTLY (Postgres) or equivalent non-blocking patterns. Production deployment is part of the design.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Diagnosing a specific slow query | `query-optimization` | query-optimization owns diagnosis; this skill is one of the responses |
| Designing the table schema and entity relationships | `data-modeling` | data-modeling owns design; this skill owns the auxiliary structures |
| Reasoning about how the schema changes over time | `schema-evolution` | schema-evolution owns versioning; this skill owns one type of schema element |
| Choosing an isolation level | `transaction-isolation` | transaction-isolation owns concurrency; this skill owns retrieval |
| Reasoning about horizontal partitioning | `sharding-strategy` | sharding owns partition; this owns within-shard retrieval |
| Tuning OS / storage-layer performance | infrastructure / storage skills | storage I/O is a layer below indexing |
