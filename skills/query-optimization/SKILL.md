# Query Optimization

## Coverage

The discipline of diagnosing and tuning specific slow queries by reading the database planner's chosen plan, identifying the root cause, and applying the right response. Covers the query planner's phases (parse → rewrite → plan → execute), the cost model and statistics that drive plan choice, the plan-node catalog (Seq Scan, Index Scan, Index Only Scan, Bitmap Heap Scan, Nested Loop, Hash Join, Merge Join, Sort, Hash Aggregate, Materialize, CTE Scan), the EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE diagnostic vocabulary, the response catalog (rewrite, add index, refresh statistics, denormalize, materialized view, isolation change, settings, application cache, accept cost), and the root-cause taxonomy that links diagnosis to response.

## Philosophy

Query optimization is largely a reading discipline. The planner exposes its decisions and the database reports the actual cost; the work is reading EXPLAIN ANALYZE output, knowing what each node means, and choosing the right response. A team that reaches for "add an index" before reading the plan is guessing; a team that reads the plan finds the actual issue and applies the right response — often *not* adding an index.

The most common root cause is cardinality misestimation: the planner thinks 100 rows will match, actually 10 million do. The chosen plan optimized for 100 is wrong for 10 million. ANALYZE, raised statistics targets, and (occasionally) extended statistics objects are where most diagnoses live. Adding indexes without addressing the statistics problem produces no improvement.

The discipline distinguishes diagnosis from response. The diagnosis is "what is the root cause of this query's slowness." The response is "what to do about it." The response catalog has many entries; matching diagnosis to the right one is the work.

   │                          maybe add index, change      │

## The Plan-Node Catalog

| Plan node | What it does | Read as |
|---|---|---|
| Seq Scan | Read every row of a table | Slow for large tables; the planner chose this for a reason — check selectivity |
| Index Scan | Use index to find rows; fetch row | Standard fast access for selective predicates |
| Index Only Scan | Use covering index; no row fetch | The cheapest read access; index includes all needed columns |
| Bitmap Heap Scan | Build bitmap from indexes; fetch matching rows | Good for AND of multiple conditions; less random I/O than nested index scans |
| Nested Loop | For each outer row, scan inner | Fast for small outer or when inner has an index; bad for large outer |
| Hash Join | Build hash from one side; probe with other | Standard fast equi-join for medium-large inputs |
| Merge Join | Merge two sorted inputs | Fast when both are pre-sorted on join key (often after Sort or matching indexes) |
| Sort | Sort rows | Expensive at scale; consider an index or ORDER BY-less query |
| Hash Aggregate | Group-by via hash table | Fast for moderate cardinality groups |
| Group Aggregate | Group-by on sorted input | Used after Sort or matching index |
| Materialize | Materialize intermediate for repeated access | Inserted by planner when sub-result is reused |
| CTE Scan | Scan CTE result | CTE may be optimization fence in older Postgres |

## Response Catalog

| Diagnosis | Right response |
|---|---|
| Sequential scan on large table; predicate is selective | Add index |
| Sequential scan; predicate is poorly selective | Accept (scan is right) or denormalize |
| Index Scan with high `Rows Removed by Filter` | Index doesn't match — partial index or composite |
| Estimated rows ≫ actual | Check if predicate is more selective than planner knows; extended statistics or rewrite |
| Estimated rows ≪ actual | ANALYZE; raise STATISTICS target |
| Nested Loop with large outer | Hint hash join or rewrite to enable hash plan |
| Hash Join with small outer | Should be nested loop with index — check why |
| Many Sort nodes | Add index matching ORDER BY |
| N+1 query pattern (application-side) | Replace with single join query |
| Correlated subquery slow | Rewrite as join or EXISTS |
| Query slow under concurrency, fast solo | Lock contention — check isolation, locking strategy |
| Stale statistics suspected | ANALYZE; consider auto-vacuum tuning |
| Query is fundamentally too much work | Materialized view, precomputed aggregate, schema change |

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] EXPLAIN ANALYZE is the starting point for every slow-query investigation. Guessing without reading the plan is replaced by reading the plan.
- [ ] The most-expensive plan node is identified and the diagnosis is targeted at that node, not the query as a whole.
- [ ] Estimated rows vs actual rows is checked at every node. Cardinality misestimates are the most common root cause.
- [ ] The response matches the diagnosis. Adding an index is one response of many; the team is not reflexively adding indexes.
- [ ] Slow queries are prioritized by aggregate impact (frequency × duration), not by individual duration alone. pg_stat_statements or equivalent is consulted.
- [ ] Query rewrites are tested for semantic equivalence and plan-shape change. Two queries that "should be equivalent" can produce different plans.
- [ ] Statistics are refreshed (ANALYZE) before deeper investigation when the planner's estimates seem off. Stale statistics are routine after bulk inserts and schema changes.
- [ ] Periodic review of top queries detects regressions caused by data growth. A query that was fast last year may not be this year.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Designing which indexes the database maintains | `indexing-strategy` | indexing-strategy owns design; this skill diagnoses |
| Designing the schema or entity relationships | `data-modeling` | data-modeling owns design; sometimes the answer is a schema change in its scope |
| Reasoning about how schema changes over time | `schema-evolution` | schema-evolution owns versioning; this owns query-level tuning |
| Choosing isolation level | `transaction-isolation` | transaction-isolation owns concurrency; this owns retrieval performance |
| Horizontal partitioning across nodes | `sharding-strategy` | sharding owns partition; this owns within-shard performance |
| Designing performance tests for the system | `performance-testing` | performance-testing owns measurement under load; this owns single-query tuning |
