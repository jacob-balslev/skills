# Graph Audit

## Coverage

- Schema conformance: checking that every `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` validates against `schemas/skill.schema.json` without errors
- Manifest sync: verifying that `examples/skills.manifest.sample.json` matches the output of `scripts/generate-manifest.js` run against the current skills
- Relation integrity: confirming that every target named under `relations.*` corresponds to a real sibling skill directory and uses the right predicate semantics (`related`/`broader`/`boundary`/`disjoint_with`/`verify_with`/`depends_on`)
- Eval artifact coherence: ensuring that `eval_artifacts: present` is backed by a real eval artifact under `examples/evals/` that names the skill in its `skill_name` field
- Grounding presence: confirming that every `scope: codebase` skill has a fully populated `grounding` block with `domain_object`, `grounding_mode`, `truth_sources`, `failure_modes`, and `evidence_priority`
- Name-directory parity: checking that a skill's `name` field matches the name of the parent directory (required for SKILL.md compatibility)

## Philosophy

Skill graphs fail silently. A broken relation or a drifted enum value does not crash the agent — it just makes retrieval subtly wrong, and subtly-wrong retrieval is worse than a crash because nothing tells you to look. The audit's job is to turn every silent bug into a loud one before the graph accumulates enough drift that agents can no longer trust its edges.

## Key Files

| File | Line range | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `schemas/skill.schema.json` | whole file | Enforces the frontmatter schema for every SKILL.md |
| `schemas/manifest.schema.json` | whole file | Enforces the compiled manifest shape |
| `docs/skill-metadata-protocol.md` | §§ Archetype, Requiredness, Schema Versioning | Source of truth for field semantics and the archetype section map |
| `scripts/skill-lint.js` | 91–114 (`AUTHORED_FIELDS_MUST_FLOW`), 149–202 (`checkSchemaParity`), 175–250 (`validateAgainstSchema`) | The canonical audit runner. Implements the six dimensions listed in Coverage plus five more: parent-directory-matches-name, cross-schema parity, sample-manifest conformance, generator parity, and routing-quality rules. See README § Validation for the full eleven-check list. |
| `scripts/lib/alias-contract.js` | whole file | Shared v3.1 alias-parity guard used by lint and manifest generation so preferred/legacy fields cannot diverge silently |
| `scripts/check-protocol-consistency.js` | C1–C7 checks | Cross-artifact protocol checker. Complementary to `skill-lint.js` — lint validates per-skill correctness; this validates that the protocol documents themselves remain consistent with the schemas. |
| `examples/skills.manifest.sample.json` | whole file | Generator-produced sample; lint fails if this drifts from `generate-manifest.js` output |

## Evals

This skill ships a comprehension-eval artifact at [`examples/evals/graph-audit.json`](https://github.com/jacob-balslev/skill-graph/blob/main/examples/evals/graph-audit.json) covering all six audit dimensions listed under Coverage. The `Verification` checklist below is the deterministic per-file audit gate; the eval file is how this skill's concept comprehension is graded by `scripts/skill-audit.js --graded`.

## Verification

Run the lint script to execute all audit checks:

```bash
node scripts/skill-lint.js
```

For a single skill:

```bash
node scripts/skill-lint.js skills/<name>
```

For the full audit including the skill-metadata-template:

```bash
node scripts/skill-lint.js --include-template
```

Exit code 0 means all checks passed. Exit code 1 means at least one check failed; each failure identifies the specific file and check.

- [ ] All SKILL.md files pass schema validation
- [ ] Manifest sample matches generator output
- [ ] All relation targets exist as real sibling skill directories
- [ ] All `eval_artifacts: present` skills have a matching eval artifact
- [ ] All `scope: codebase` skills have a complete `grounding` block
- [ ] Every skill's `name` field matches its parent directory name (SKILL.md compatibility)

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `documentation` | The task is authoring or restructuring skill prose, not auditing metadata |
| `refactor` | The task is restructuring skill body sections while keeping the contract stable |
| `debugging` | The task is chasing a runtime failure in an agent, not validating graph metadata |
