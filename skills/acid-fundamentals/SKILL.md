# ACID Fundamentals

## Coverage

The four foundational transactional properties — Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability — that define the contract between a database and the application using it. Covers what each property formally guarantees, the implementation mechanisms underneath each (write-ahead logging for atomicity; locking and MVCC for isolation; constraint checking for consistency; synchronous storage flush for durability), the configuration-dependent strength of each property, the BASE alternative model for systems that trade ACID guarantees for availability, the C-of-ACID vs C-of-CAP distinction that is the most-frequently-confused concept in the space, and the historical record from Gray's transaction model through Härder & Reuter's 1983 formalization.

## Philosophy

ACID is the precise vocabulary the database industry uses to describe transactional guarantees. Before ACID, claims were vague; after ACID, a system's behavior on each of four orthogonal axes is the conversation. The strategic value of the frame is *not* the acronym itself but the discipline of asking, for any database in any configuration, what each property actually guarantees and what the application can rely on.

The frame's defining property is that it names four *orthogonal* axes. A system can be atomic without being isolated; it can be durable without being consistent in the CAP sense; it can be consistent (database constraints satisfied) without being consistent across replicas. The four-letter frame is not a one-dimensional rating; it is a vector.

The discipline is in the configuration. "Postgres is ACID" is a vague claim; "Postgres at read committed isolation with synchronous_commit on with foreign-key constraints enforced gives us A, I (at read-committed level), D, and C" is the precise statement. Knowing what your specific database guarantees in your specific configuration is operational hygiene; assuming the default is a class of incident.

## The Four Properties — Precise Definitions

| Property | Guarantee | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Atomicity | All-or-nothing per transaction; no partial state visible after failure | Write-ahead logging + rollback/redo |
| Consistency | Database integrity constraints satisfied across the transaction | Foreign keys, NOT NULL, unique indexes, CHECK constraints, triggers |
| Isolation | Concurrent transactions appear serialized | Locking, MVCC, serializable snapshot isolation |
| Durability | Committed effects survive failure | Synchronous WAL flush, replication to durable storage |

Each property is graded. Atomicity is essentially binary. Isolation has five+ levels (see `transaction-isolation`). Durability has multiple configurations (local sync, local async, replicated sync, quorum). Consistency has database-level rules vs application-level rules.

## The Two C's — ACID vs CAP

| Property | What it means | Example |
|---|---|---|
| ACID Consistency | Database integrity constraints satisfied | FK reference resolves; UNIQUE constraint holds |
| CAP Consistency | All replicas agree on the current value | All replicas return the same balance for account #1234 |

A database can be ACID-Consistent and CAP-Inconsistent (constraints hold; replicas disagree). A database can be CAP-Consistent and ACID-Inconsistent (replicas agree; foreign key was violated). They are different concepts with the same letter and are the most-confused pair in the space.

## ACID vs BASE

| Property | ACID | BASE |
|---|---|---|
| A | Atomicity per transaction | Basically Available |
| C | Database-level Consistency | Soft state |
| I | Isolation between concurrent transactions | (no I in BASE) |
| D | Durability | Eventually consistent |
| Trade | Strong guarantees, limited throughput/availability under partition | High throughput/availability, weaker correctness guarantees |
| Typical use | Transactional cores: orders, payments, accounts | High-throughput non-transactional: streams, analytics, caches |
| Examples | Postgres, Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB transactions | Cassandra, Riak (default), DynamoDB (default) |

Most production architectures use both, picking per component.

## Configuration Matters

Three configuration knobs that change what your database actually guarantees:

| Knob | Default in Postgres | Effect when changed |
|---|---|---|
| `synchronous_commit` | `on` (durable) | `off` → commit acknowledged before WAL flush; last few commits lost on crash |
| Isolation level | `read committed` | `serializable` is strongest; `read uncommitted` allows dirty reads |
| Replication mode | none | Synchronous replication = D guarantees include replica; async = primary-only |

Knowing your production configuration — not assuming the default — is operational hygiene.

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] The team can name what each ACID property guarantees and what it does not, distinct from the CAP properties.
- [ ] The current database's configuration is known: isolation level, durability config, replication mode. The team is not relying on assumed defaults.
- [ ] ACID's C and CAP's C are distinguished in design discussions. Using "consistency" without qualifier produces confused decisions.
- [ ] Application-level invariants (business rules) are recognized as the application's responsibility, not delegated to the database's ACID consistency.
- [ ] For systems that mix ACID and BASE components, the boundary is explicit: which data lives in which model and why.
- [ ] Cross-transaction atomicity (sagas, two-phase commit) is recognized as a different problem from in-transaction atomicity. ACID does not solve cross-transaction coordination.
- [ ] Production incidents that involve data loss or corruption are diagnosed against the specific ACID property that failed — and against the configuration that determined the failure boundary.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Choosing an isolation level for a specific workload | `transaction-isolation` | transaction-isolation owns the I axis in operational depth |
| Reasoning about replica agreement, availability under partition | `cap-theorem-tradeoffs` | CAP is the distributed-systems frame; this is the single-system frame |
| Designing the database schema or entity model | `data-modeling` | data-modeling owns design; this owns runtime guarantees |
| Applying a zero-downtime migration | `database-migration` | database-migration owns migration mechanics |
| Designing patterns for replicated systems | `replication-patterns` | replication is the operational layer above single-node ACID |
| Choosing between ACID and BASE for a new system | `cap-theorem-tradeoffs` + this skill | cap-theorem provides the distributed frame; this provides the transactional frame |
