# Schema Evolution

## Coverage

The discipline of changing a database schema over time without breaking deployed application code. Covers the expand/contract (parallel change) pattern as the foundational technique, the backwards-and-forwards compatibility envelope each intermediate state must satisfy, the catalog of schema-change types and their safety profiles (additive, constraint-tightening, destructive, renaming, type-change), the backfill strategies (no-backfill, batched, background, dual-write-only, lazy), the dual-write / dual-read transition patterns, the deploy-ordering rules (migration-first vs code-first), and the relationship to the underlying database-migration tooling that executes individual steps.

## Philosophy

Schema and deployed code are co-evolving systems. The danger is desynchronization — schema changes break running code; code changes assume a schema that hasn't been deployed yet. Expand/contract is the protocol that keeps both sides compatible during transition: additively introduce the new shape, migrate, then contract the old.

The discipline is not in the individual ALTER TABLE statement (that's database-migration's concern). It is in the *sequencing* across migrations and deploys, the compatibility envelope at every intermediate point, and the rollback discipline that keeps the system recoverable when a step fails.

The most consequential phases are the boundaries — entering migrate (the dual-write/dual-read transition) and entering contract (the irreversible drop). Knowing the criteria for crossing each boundary is the operational hygiene that separates evolved systems from broken ones.

## The Expand / Migrate / Contract Phases

```
   ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Phase 1: EXPAND                         │
   │ • Add new column / table / index        │
   │ • Old shape unchanged                   │
   │ • Old code continues working unchanged  │
   │ • New code can use new shape if deployed│
   │ • Rollback: drop new shape              │
   └────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    │
                    ▼
   ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Phase 2: MIGRATE (multi-deploy)         │
   │ • Deploy code that dual-writes          │
   │ • Backfill existing data (batched)      │
   │ • Deploy code that dual-reads (new w/   │
   │   fallback to old)                      │
   │ • Verify production traffic on new      │
   │ • Deploy code that single-reads new     │
   │ • Rollback: revert code; old shape OK   │
   └────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    │
                    ▼
   ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Phase 3: CONTRACT (irreversible)        │
   │ • Drop old column / table / index       │
   │ • No code references old shape          │
   │ • Rollback: impossible (data is gone)   │
   └────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The time between expand-complete and contract-start is normally days or weeks, not minutes.

## Change-Type Safety Matrix

| Change | Single-step safe? | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Add nullable column | Yes | Direct ALTER |
| Add column with NOT NULL DEFAULT | Yes (in Postgres 11+ for constant defaults; verify per database) | Direct ALTER |
| Add column with NOT NULL no default | No | Expand: add nullable; backfill; add constraint with NOT VALID; VALIDATE |
| Add new table | Yes | Direct CREATE TABLE |
| Add index | Yes (with CONCURRENTLY in Postgres) | CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY |
| Add foreign key | No (validation locks) | ADD FK NOT VALID; then VALIDATE CONSTRAINT separately |
| Add CHECK constraint | No (validation locks) | Same NOT VALID + VALIDATE pattern |
| Add UNIQUE constraint | No (needs verified uniqueness) | Verify no duplicates; CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY; ADD CONSTRAINT USING INDEX |
| Drop column | No (deployed code references it) | Full expand/contract |
| Drop table | No (deployed code references it) | Full expand/contract |
| Drop index | Yes (only if no query relies on it) | DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY |
| Rename column | No | Full expand/contract: add new; dual-write; backfill; switch reads; drop old |
| Rename table | No | Same expand/contract pattern |
| Change column type | No | Add new column; backfill with conversion; switch reads; drop old |
| Change DEFAULT | Yes | Direct ALTER (affects only future inserts) |

## The Deploy-Ordering Rule

| Direction | When safe | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| **Migration first, then code** | Migration is additive (column added; nothing depending on it) | Migration runs; old code keeps working; new code rolls out and uses new |
| **Code first, then migration** | Code is backwards-compatible with old schema | New code rolls out; tolerates old schema; migration runs; new code now uses new shape |
| **Coordinated (multi-step)** | Most non-trivial changes | Expand/migrate/contract spans multiple deploys |

The deploy-ordering choice is a design decision per change. The expand/contract pattern's value is that it makes the ordering *explicit* and *survivable* at every intermediate point.

## When To Contract

The criteria for crossing into the irreversible contract phase:

- [ ] All deployed code reads exclusively from the new shape (verified via code inspection or runtime monitoring).
- [ ] All deployed code writes exclusively to the new shape, or writes to both with the old write being redundant.
- [ ] The backfill is complete and verified — no existing rows have inconsistent state.
- [ ] Observability for the new shape is in place; the old shape's removal would not blind monitoring.
- [ ] The migrate phase has been stable in production for a defined observation period (typically days).
- [ ] Rollback path during the contract is not required — the team has decided the change is permanent.

Premature contract is a common cause of incidents. The contract phase is irreversible by definition.

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] Every non-trivial schema change is planned as expand → migrate → contract, not as a single deploy.
- [ ] The compatibility envelope is explicit: which code versions are expected to run, and with which schema versions, at every intermediate point.
- [ ] Constraint-tightening changes use the NOT VALID + VALIDATE pattern (or equivalent in the specific database) to avoid blocking writes during validation.
- [ ] Index creation uses CONCURRENTLY (Postgres) or equivalent non-blocking mechanism.
- [ ] Dual-write / dual-read transitions have defined criteria for advancing to the next state — not "we'll know when we're ready."
- [ ] The contract phase has explicit verification criteria (above list) before it runs.
- [ ] Backfill jobs are batched (rows in tractable chunks) and resumable (can pick up where they left off after failure).
- [ ] Rollback is preserved through expand and migrate; the team accepts irreversibility only at contract.
- [ ] Migrations are reviewed for the *sequence* and the *envelope*, not just the syntax.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Executing one ALTER TABLE migration mechanically | `database-migration` | database-migration owns the mechanics; this owns the sequencing |
| Designing the schema from scratch | `data-modeling` | data-modeling owns design; this owns evolution |
| Deciding which indexes to maintain | `indexing-strategy` | indexing-strategy owns design; this owns how the index set evolves |
| Tuning a slow query | `query-optimization` | query-optimization owns retrieval performance; this owns schema change |
| Horizontal partitioning | `sharding-strategy` | sharding owns partition; this owns schema shape changes |
| Choosing isolation level | `transaction-isolation` | transaction-isolation owns concurrency; this owns shape |
