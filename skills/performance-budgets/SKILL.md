# Performance Budgets

## Coverage

The discipline of declaring measurable thresholds for performance-affecting properties and enforcing them as quality contracts. Covers the four governing properties (metric, threshold, percentile, consequence), the three budget axes (time, size, count), the three measurement modes (lab, field, synthetic), the Core Web Vitals set as the most-adopted public budget standard, the RAIL model as the interaction-class framework, Lighthouse budgets.json as a declarative enforcement mechanism, and the per-route granularity that real applications require.

## Philosophy

A budget is a contract written in numbers. Three things distinguish a real budget from a tracked metric:

1. **It is set before the spending decisions, not after.** A budget that emerges from post-hoc retrospectives is a description; a budget that constrains the next feature is a discipline.
2. **It binds to a consequence, not a dashboard.** A number that someone watches and worries about is a metric. A number that fails a build is a budget.
3. **It speaks for the user.** Every other voice in the room — engineering, design, product, analytics, marketing — has its own incentives. The budget is the institutional voice of the user, present at every commit, refusing to grant exceptions silently.

The hardest part of performance budgeting is not setting the number — it is committing to enforce it when enforcement is expensive. The first time the budget blocks a feature, the discipline is tested. A team that grants an exception "just this once" has reduced the budget to a metric. A team that delays the feature, cuts another feature, or extends the budget through a documented amendment has kept the contract intact.

## The Four Parts of a Real Budget

A complete budget statement names all four:

> **LCP at p75 must be below 2.5 seconds in field measurement; breach blocks deploy.**

| Part | This budget's value | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Metric | LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | Cited by name, not by "speed" or "load time"; LCP has a precise definition |
| Threshold | 2.5 seconds | A number, not a band; matches the Core Web Vitals "Good" boundary |
| Percentile | p75 | Whose experience this threshold describes — the slower three-quarters get worse |
| Consequence | Deploy blocked | The discipline; without this, the rest is a tracked metric |

A statement that says "LCP should be fast" or "we target a Lighthouse score of 90" is missing at least one of these parts. The missing parts are where the discipline leaks.

## The Three Axes

| Axis | Examples | Why budgeted |
|---|---|---|
| **Time** | LCP, INP, CLS, TTFB, FCP, TTI | Direct user-perceived latency |
| **Size** | JS bytes, CSS bytes, image bytes, font bytes, total transfer | Bounds parse, network, and execution cost — proxies for time on slow devices |
| **Count** | Requests, third-party scripts, fonts loaded, DOM nodes | Connection overhead, rendering cost, attack surface |

Size and count budgets are upstream of time budgets: a page that ships 3MB of JS will fail INP on a mid-range Android device regardless of how clever the optimization is. Setting all three axes catches regression at the level closest to where it happened.

## The Core Web Vitals Set

Google's Core Web Vitals are the most widely adopted public budget standard. They are the default starting point for a project that does not yet have a budget.

| Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | ≤ 2.5s | 2.5–4.0s | > 4.0s | Time from navigation start to the largest above-fold element rendering |
| INP (Interaction to Next Paint) | ≤ 200ms | 200–500ms | > 500ms | The worst observed delay between any user interaction and the next paint, in the session |
| CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) | ≤ 0.1 | 0.1–0.25 | > 0.25 | Sum of unexpected layout shifts, weighted by impact area |

All three are measured at p75 in field data. The bands come from Google's published correlation between metric value and user-retention proxies.

INP replaced First Input Delay (FID) as a Core Web Vital in March 2024. FID measured only the first interaction; INP measures the worst across the session. A site that passes FID may fail INP; the budget update is not cosmetic.

## The RAIL Model

A complementary framework that classifies interactions by their latency budget:

| Class | Budget | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Response** | < 100ms from user input to acknowledgement | Button press feedback, hover, focus |
| **Animation** | < 16ms per frame (60fps) | Scroll, transition, drag |
| **Idle** | Idle work in chunks ≤ 50ms | Analytics flush, prefetching, deferred rendering |
| **Load** | < 5s on a slow 3G mid-range mobile | First navigation to interactive |

RAIL is older than Core Web Vitals but still load-bearing as a per-interaction-class budget. CWV is the public-facing summary; RAIL is the design-time guidance for what each interaction should cost.

## Lab vs Field

| Mode | Tool examples | Strengths | Limitations |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lab | Lighthouse, WebPageTest, sitespeed.io | Reproducible, fast, integrable in CI | Constructed environment may not reflect real users |
| Field (RUM) | CrUX, web-vitals.js + own RUM, Sentry Performance, Datadog RUM | Authoritative; reflects real users on real devices | Slow feedback; data arrives after the regression ships |
| Synthetic | Scheduled lab runs against production from multiple regions | Trend tracking; geographic coverage | Still lab; same constructed-environment limits |

The discipline that works:

- **Lab as pre-deploy gate.** Lighthouse-CI or equivalent runs on every PR; budget breach blocks the merge. Catches regressions before they ship.
- **Field as authoritative assessment.** RUM data reports the p75 the user actually experienced. If the field metric breaches even though the lab passed, the lab is missing something — investigate and fix the gap.
- **Synthetic for trend.** Scheduled production runs from a representative set of geographies; useful for week-over-week regression spotting and for the rare case where production diverges from staging.

## Per-Route Budgets

A site-wide budget either fits the strictest route or the loosest. Neither is right. A realistic budget table:

| Route profile | LCP target | INP target | JS budget | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Marketing landing | 1.5s | 200ms | 100KB compressed | Largest revenue impact per millisecond; competition is fast |
| Product detail | 2.0s | 200ms | 200KB | Catalog content + image-heavy; users have intent |
| Search results | 2.5s | 200ms | 250KB | Server work per query; users tolerate slightly more for relevance |
| Logged-in dashboard | 3.0s | 300ms | 400KB | Personalized; users have committed; richer UI |
| Admin panel | 4.0s | 500ms | 600KB | Low-traffic; high-functionality; small known audience |

The numbers above are illustrative — the actual values come from the project's content, audience, and competitive position. The shape is the load-bearing part: differentiate per route, with stricter budgets on the routes that face the cold-arriving user and looser budgets on the routes that face the committed one.

## Lighthouse budgets.json

A declarative enforcement file that Lighthouse and Lighthouse-CI consume:

```json
{
  "path": "/",
  "resourceSizes": [
    { "resourceType": "script", "budget": 200 },
    { "resourceType": "stylesheet", "budget": 50 },
    { "resourceType": "image", "budget": 300 },
    { "resourceType": "font", "budget": 100 },
    { "resourceType": "total", "budget": 800 }
  ],
  "resourceCounts": [
    { "resourceType": "third-party", "budget": 10 },
    { "resourceType": "script", "budget": 20 }
  ],
  "timings": [
    { "metric": "interactive", "budget": 3000 },
    { "metric": "first-contentful-paint", "budget": 1500 }
  ]
}
```

The file is checked into the repo, applies per path, and triggers a Lighthouse-CI failure when breached. It is the cheapest place to make a budget enforceable; the consequence (CI failure) is the property that makes it a budget rather than documentation.

## The Discipline of Calibration

A budget set too tight blocks all work and gets disabled. A budget set too loose generates no signal. Calibration is the practice of setting budgets that are slightly stricter than current performance, ratcheting them tighter as optimization work lands.

**Ratchet pattern:**

1. Measure current p75 on the route.
2. Set the budget at the current value + a small margin (5–10%).
3. Land optimization work; budget enforces no regression.
4. When the optimization shows in field data, tighten the budget to the new p75 + margin.
5. Repeat.

The pattern prevents the "budget is impossible from day one" failure mode and the "budget drifts forever" failure mode. Each tightening is small enough to land without negotiation; the cumulative effect over a year is substantial.

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] Every budget statement names all four parts (metric, threshold, percentile, consequence).
- [ ] At least one budget on each of the three axes (time, size, count) — single-axis budgets miss whole classes of regression.
- [ ] Field measurement (RUM, CrUX) is the authoritative source for at least the Core Web Vitals; lab measurement is the pre-deploy gate.
- [ ] Per-route budgets exist where routes have meaningfully different content profiles (landing vs dashboard, anonymous vs logged-in).
- [ ] The consequence is automated — a CI step, a deploy gate, a rollback trigger — not a manual review.
- [ ] Lighthouse budgets.json (or equivalent declarative file) is checked into the repo, version-controlled, and reviewed in the same PR as performance-affecting changes.
- [ ] INP is part of the time budget set (FID alone is insufficient for sessions with multiple interactions).
- [ ] Third-party scripts are inside the budget, not exempted — the user experiences their cost.
- [ ] The percentile is documented and matches industry convention (p75 for CWV) or has an explicit reason for differing.
- [ ] A calibration plan exists — when and how the budget tightens as performance improves.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Profiling a specific slow path and deciding what to fix | `performance-engineering` | performance-engineering owns the diagnostic and optimization activity; this skill owns the contract that defines failure |
| Choosing a rendering model for a route | `rendering-models` | rendering-models bounds what budgets are achievable; this skill consumes that input |
| Designing telemetry spans, traces, or metric pipelines | `observability-modeling` | observability-modeling designs the signals; this skill defines what level of those signals counts as a breach |
| Writing tests for behavior correctness | `testing-strategy` | testing-strategy owns runtime correctness; budgets are an analogous discipline for non-functional properties |
| Designing HTTP cache headers, compression, or transport | `http-semantics` | http-semantics owns the wire-level optimization; budgets are downstream of the choice |
