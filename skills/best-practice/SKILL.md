# Best Practice — Cross-Cutting Quality Enforcement

## Domain Context

**What is this skill?** Cross-cutting best practices enforcement across code, templates, skills, prompts, scripts, documentation, pages, and design. The enforcement layer that catches violations any specialist might miss.

## Coverage

Cross-cutting best practices enforcement across code, templates, skills, prompts, scripts, documentation, pages, and design. The sections below contain the detailed rules, examples, and boundaries for using this skill correctly.

## Coverage (14 domains)

Code quality (SOLID, strict TypeScript, DRY/KISS), documentation (ADRs, self-documenting names, TSDoc), security (OWASP Top 10:2025, secret management, input validation), accessibility (WCAG 2.2, semantic HTML, keyboard operability), performance (Core Web Vitals, code splitting, image optimization), design systems (token hierarchy, dark mode, composable APIs), testing (pyramid shape, behavior-not-implementation, coverage guardrails), DevOps (trunk-based development, progressive delivery, pipeline-as-code), AI/LLM skill design (RCCF structure, eval methodology, scope boundaries), Next.js App Router patterns (Server Components default, Server Action security, explicit caching), UX & UI composition (F-pattern for data surfaces, one L1 focal point per zone, density-first spacing), visual hierarchy (surface layering, card/banner depth, information density vs whitespace), typographic hierarchy (6-level heading contract, Minor Third scale, 4 canonical weights, h6 micro-labels), and color hierarchy (greyscale chrome, financial-only semantic color, triple encoding for colorblind safety).

> **Authority:** Cross-domain quality gate. Does not override specialist skills — catches violations that fall between specialist boundaries. Defer to specialists for depth.
> **Scope:** "Small focused changes" means scope discipline, NOT code reduction. See craft-doctrine for the enrichment principle.

## Philosophy

This skill exists because quality violations most often occur at the boundaries between specialist domains — a developer focuses on getting the TypeScript right but ships a `<div onClick>` instead of a `<button>`, or nails the component logic but hardcodes a hex color. No single specialist skill catches all of these; each covers its own depth. Without a cross-cutting enforcement layer, agents produce code that passes within any one domain but fails the "would a senior engineer approve this PR?" test. Observed failure modes that motivated this skill: SQL injection via string interpolation passing TypeScript strict mode, skipped test.skip entries accumulating into permanent dead tests, Server Actions treated as internal functions despite being public HTTP endpoints, and heading hierarchy violations slipping through because neither the a11y skill nor the design-guide skill owned the overlap zone. This skill is the net that catches what falls between specialist boundaries.

---

## Cross-Domain Synergy
As the baseline enforcement layer, this skill connects:
- **ui-ux & composition-theory**: Enforcing layout rules (one L1 focal point, F-pattern for data, density-first spacing).
- **visual-design & design-guide**: Surface hierarchy, card depth, information density vs whitespace balance.
- **typography & semantics**: Strict adherence to 6-level heading hierarchy, Minor Third scale, readable names.
- **color-science**: Greyscale chrome enforcement, financial-only semantic color, triple encoding for colorblind safety.
- **copywriting**: Validating copy inside PRs against the brand's calm-authority tone.

## 1. Code Quality

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| Strict TypeScript | `"strict": true`, no `any`, no `@ts-ignore` without explanation |
| SOLID principles | One responsibility per module, depend on abstractions |
| DRY / KISS / YAGNI | No duplicate blocks >10 lines, no premature abstraction |
| Explicit return types | Every exported function declares its return type |
| Small focused changes | PRs touch one logical concern, <400 changed lines (excl. generated) |

> Anti-patterns and checklist: `references/code-quality-checklist.md`. See semantics for naming rules, craft-doctrine for quality dimensions.

## 2. Documentation

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| Self-documenting names | If a name needs a comment, rename it |
| Comments explain WHY | Code explains what; comments explain intent, gotchas, business rules |
| ADRs for decisions | `docs/adr/` — Context, Decision, Alternatives, Consequences |
| TSDoc on public APIs | `@param`, `@returns`, `@throws` on exported functions |
| No stale TODOs | Every `// TODO` must reference a ticket: `// TODO(SH-1234)` |

> See adr for ADR creation methodology. See doc-updater for the documentation update protocol.

## 3. Security (OWASP Top 10:2025)

| Priority | Rule | Check |
|----------|------|-------|
| A01 | Broken Access Control | Every endpoint verifies auth AND authz; default-deny |
| A03 | Supply Chain | No high/critical CVEs; pin dependency versions |
| A05 | Injection | Parameterized queries only; Zod validation on all input |
| A10 | Exception Handling | No stack traces to clients; all errors caught server-side |
| — | Secret management | No secrets in source; `.env*` in `.gitignore` |

> Deep reference: `references/security-checklist.md`. See security-scanning for SQL injection prevention, CSRF, and webhook security details. See gdpr-compliance for PII masking, per-provider erasure handlers, and retention enforcement.

## 4. Accessibility (WCAG 2.2)

| Rule | Standard | Check |
|------|----------|-------|
| Semantic HTML first | WCAG 4.1.2 | `<button>` not `<div onClick>`, native `<dialog>`, `<nav>` |
| Keyboard operable | WCAG 2.1.1 | All functionality via Tab/Enter/Space/Arrows; no traps |
| Color contrast | WCAG 1.4.3 | 4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI components |
| Target size | WCAG 2.5.8 | 24px WCAG minimum; **Sales Hub enforces 44x44px** |
| Heading hierarchy | WCAG 1.3.1 | Sequential h1>h2>h3, no skipping, one h1 per page |

> Deep reference: `references/accessibility-checklist.md`. See a11y for Sales Hub 44px targets, Axe-Core Playwright tests, focus-ring system, reduced-motion strategy, and live-region placement.

## 5. Performance

| Rule | Threshold | Check |
|------|-----------|-------|
| LCP | <2.5s | No lazy-load on above-fold images |
| INP | <200ms | No main-thread tasks >50ms; defer non-critical JS |
| CLS | <0.1 | Images have `width`/`height`; no layout shifts |
| Bundle discipline | Monitor in CI | Dynamic `import()` for routes; no full-library imports |
| Image optimization | AVIF/WebP | `next/image` with proper sizing; `loading="lazy"` below fold |

> Deep reference: `references/performance-checklist.md`. See react-best-practices for 57 detailed performance optimization rules across 8 categories.

## 6. Design System

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| Three-tier token hierarchy | Primitive > Semantic > Component; never use primitives in components |
| No hardcoded values | All colors, spacing, typography via tokens — never raw hex or px |
| Dark mode via CSS custom properties | `:root` light, `[data-theme="dark"]` overrides |
| Composable component APIs | Variant props from tokens, not arbitrary style overrides |
| No `!important` | Fix specificity, don't override it |

> See design-guide for Sales Hub heading tokens, surface hierarchy, and financial display rules. See design-token-architecture for W3C DTCG format, naming conventions, and CVA patterns.

## 7. Testing

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| Pyramid shape | Many unit, some integration, few E2E |
| Test behavior, not implementation | Public interfaces and observable outcomes only |
| Coverage guardrails | 70-80% line coverage; focus on logic and edge cases |
| No dead tests | No `test.skip` / `xit` without linked ticket |
| Co-located test files | `.test.ts` next to source `.ts` |

> Deep reference: `references/testing-patterns.md`. See craft-doctrine for quality dimensions that define what "tested" means per artifact type.

## 8. DevOps & CI/CD

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| Trunk-based development | Short-lived branches (<2 days); feature flags control visibility |
| Pipeline as code | Build, lint, typecheck, test, security scan — all automated gates |
| Feature flag lifecycle | Owner + expiration; remove within 30 days of GA |
| No force operations | No `--force` push, no `--no-verify`, no `reset --hard` without cause |
| Rollback strategy | Health checks + documented recovery path |

## 9. AI/LLM Skill & Prompt Design

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| RCCF structure | Role, Context, Constraints, Format in every prompt |
| Structured outputs | JSON schemas or Zod validation; never free-text parsing |
| Few-shot examples | 2-3 examples for non-trivial tasks |
| Eval coverage | Every skill has evals.json with 7+ scenarios |
| Explicit scope boundaries | Define what skill does AND does not do |

> See skill-scaffold for skill creation methodology. See craft-doctrine for skill content quality dimensions.

## 10. Next.js App Router

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| Server Components default | `'use client'` is opt-in, pushed down the tree |
| Server Actions = public API | Zod validation + auth check as first two operations |
| Explicit caching | `revalidatePath` / `revalidateTag` after mutations |
| Loading states | `loading.tsx` or Suspense boundaries for async routes |
| No Pages Router patterns | No `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, `_app.tsx` |

> Deep reference: `references/nextjs-patterns.md`. See nextauth-patterns for auth guard choice (requireAuth vs requireOrgAuth vs withOrgAuth) and 13 critical anti-patterns. See middleware-architecture for the request pipeline (CSRF, CSP, onboarding redirect).

---

## Cross-Domain Enforcement Priorities

These rules appear across 3+ domains — **highest enforcement weight**:

1. **Validate all input server-side** (Security + Next.js + Testing)
2. **Never expose secrets or PII** (Security + DevOps + GDPR)
3. **Semantic HTML over ARIA hacks** (Accessibility + Design System)
4. **Automate quality gates in CI** (Code Quality + Testing + DevOps + Security)
5. **Test behavior, not implementation** (Testing + Code Quality)
6. **Token hierarchy, never hardcoded values** (Design System + Performance)
7. **Server Components by default** (Next.js + Performance + Security)
8. **Small, focused changes** (Code Quality + DevOps + AI/LLM)
9. **Explicit caching strategy** (Next.js + Performance)
10. **Structure over verbosity** (AI/LLM + Documentation)

- [ ] **Tests:** New logic has tests, behavior-focused, no dead tests
- [ ] **DevOps:** No force operations, feature flags have owners, pipeline passes
- [ ] **AI/LLM:** Skills have evals, prompts have structure, scope is bounded
- [ ] **Next.js:** Server Components default, Server Actions secured, caching explicit
