## Concept of the skill

**What it is:** The Ansoff Matrix is a product-market growth framework. It classifies growth options by whether the product is existing or new and whether the market is existing or new.

**Mental model:** Define the current product and market first. Then classify each option: sell current products to current markets, sell current products to new markets, build new products for current markets, or build new products for new markets.

**Why it exists:** Agents often talk about growth without stating what is actually changing. This skill makes product and market novelty explicit so risk, assumptions, sequencing, and follow-on validation become visible.

**What it is NOT:** It is not SWOT/TOWS, PESTEL, Five Forces, Playing to Win, Seven Powers, BCG portfolio analysis, OKRs, or a valuation model.

**Adjacent concepts:** product-market fit, growth vectors, concentration strategy, diversification, market entry, product strategy, corporate strategy, strategic distance, option sequencing.

**One-line analogy:** Ansoff maps how far a growth option moves from known products and known customers.

**Common misconception:** The four quadrants do not choose the strategy. They classify growth direction so evidence and validation can decide what to do next.

# Ansoff Matrix

## Domain Context

Use the Ansoff Matrix for business strategy, product strategy, market-entry preparation, corporate growth planning, nonprofit program expansion, and review of existing growth-option work. Use public, aggregate, or synthetic examples only. Do not include personal data, customer data, payment data, secrets, confidential deal details, or private business facts in examples or evals.

The matrix is strongest when the user has several possible growth directions and needs a clear product-market framing before deeper analysis. It is weaker when the decision is already about industry structure, macro forces, durable competitive advantage, portfolio capital allocation, quantified option value, or execution goals.

Use the user's terms when possible. "Product" can mean product, service, program, offer, feature bundle, or solution. "Market" can mean customer segment, use case, geography, channel, industry vertical, buyer type, or mission. Name the definition you choose before classifying options.

## Coverage

This skill teaches agents to:

1. Define the current product and current market baseline before using the matrix.
2. Translate messy growth ideas into product change and market change.
3. Classify options into market penetration, market development, product development, or diversification.
4. Distinguish product novelty from market novelty when both are fuzzy.
5. Surface strategic distance, uncertainty, capability gaps, and evidence needs.
6. Compare and sequence options without pretending a quadrant label is a recommendation.
7. Use lower-risk and higher-risk language carefully, without universal guarantees.
8. Route downstream work to the right method once product-market growth direction is clear.

## Philosophy of the skill

The Ansoff Matrix is useful because it makes growth concrete. "Grow revenue" can mean deeper adoption in a known market, geographic expansion, a new offer for existing customers, or a leap into both a new offer and a new customer world. Those moves differ in evidence needs, capability requirements, uncertainty, and organizational strain.

The method is intentionally simple. Its value comes from disciplined classification and the questions that follow. A good Ansoff pass tells the user what is familiar, what is novel, what must be true, why risk changes, and what validation method should come next. It should never smuggle in a recommendation just because one quadrant sounds more ambitious.

## Workflow

### 1. Frame the growth question

Start by naming the unit of analysis and the baseline.

```text
Actor:
Current product / service / program:
Current customer or market:
Growth objective:
Time horizon:
Geography or channel:
Existing evidence:
Decision this matrix must inform:
```

Reject vague scopes such as "grow the company" or "expand internationally" unless the user explicitly wants a first-pass brainstorm. Narrow by offer, customer segment, channel, geography, mission, or planning horizon.

### 2. Define existing vs new

The matrix depends on a baseline. Existing and new are relative to the actor, not absolute to the world.

| Axis | Existing means | New means | Questions to ask |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product or offer | The actor already sells, operates, or can deliver it with known capabilities | The actor must build, acquire, adapt, package, or learn a materially different offer | Is the value proposition materially different? Are delivery, support, compliance, or production capabilities different? |
| Market or customer | The actor already serves this segment, channel, geography, use case, or mission | The actor must reach a materially different segment, channel, geography, use case, or mission | Do buying criteria, access channels, regulations, competitors, economics, or adoption behavior change? |

If an option is "mostly existing" but needs adaptation, label the ambiguity and explain the assumption. Do not force a clean quadrant when the product or market boundary is uncertain.

### 3. Map each option to a quadrant

| Quadrant | Product | Market | Core question | Typical evidence needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Market penetration | Existing | Existing | Can we get more share, usage, frequency, retention, or revenue from the current market? | current adoption, churn, share, pricing, channel productivity, sales capacity, competitor response |
| Market development | Existing | New | Can the current offer work for a new segment, geography, channel, use case, or mission? | customer differences, distribution access, localization, regulation, willingness to pay, channel economics |
| Product development | New | Existing | Can we build a new or meaningfully changed offer for customers we already understand? | unmet needs, product feasibility, roadmap capacity, adoption intent, support burden, cannibalization |
| Diversification | New | New | Can we credibly enter a new product-market domain? | strategic fit, capability gaps, acquisition vs build, governance, capital needs, learning plan, downside protection |

Do not collapse market development and product development because both sound like "expansion." One changes who or where the offer serves; the other changes what is offered to customers the actor already knows.

### 4. Surface assumptions and risk

For each option, state what becomes less familiar.

```text
Option:
Quadrant:
Product novelty:
Market novelty:
Why this option is plausible:
Evidence already available:
Assumptions:
Strategic distance: low / medium / high
Risk drivers:
Capability gaps:
Next validation:
```

Risk often rises as product and market novelty rise, with diversification usually requiring the largest learning burden. Treat that as a planning heuristic, not a universal law. A poorly executed market penetration move can still be risky; a diversification move can be reduced through acquisition, partnership, staged tests, or prior adjacency.

### 5. Compare and sequence options

A good Ansoff output should help the user decide what to analyze next.

Use these filters:

- Does the option match the stated growth objective and time horizon?
- Is the product or market novelty manageable for this actor?
- What existing capabilities transfer, and what new capabilities are required?
- What evidence would make the option a clear no-go?
- Can the option be staged, piloted, partnered, or acquired?
- Does one option create learning that reduces risk for a later option?
- What method is needed to choose, validate, or finance the option?

When multiple options remain plausible, show a sequence such as "test market penetration first to learn price sensitivity, then market development in one adjacent channel, then revisit product development." Do not imply that lower novelty is always better. Fit to objective matters.

### 6. Route to downstream work

The Ansoff Matrix is an input to strategy work, not the end of it.

| Remaining question | Next method |
| --- | --- |
| What internal strengths/weaknesses and external opportunities/threats shape these options? | SWOT/TOWS |
| What macro forces could help or block this product-market move? | PESTEL |
| Is the target industry structurally attractive? | Porter's Five Forces |
| What integrated strategy should we commit to? | Playing to Win |
| Could the move create or strengthen a durable advantage? | Seven Powers |
| Which option has the best probability-weighted value? | Expected Value |
| Which claims are weak, stale, or unsupported? | Epistemic Grounding |

## Classification Tests

Use these tests when the prompt is ambiguous.

| Prompt pattern | Likely quadrant | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Increase usage, retention, share, pricing, or frequency among current customers" | Market penetration | Same offer and same market; deeper capture |
| "Sell the same offer through a new channel, region, customer segment, or use case" | Market development | Same offer; new market definition |
| "Build a new tier, feature bundle, service line, or product for current customers" | Product development | New offer; familiar customers |
| "Enter a new category for customers we do not currently serve" | Diversification | New offer and new market |
| "Acquire a company in an adjacent category" | Usually diversification | Treat acquisition as a vehicle; still classify product-market distance |
| "Reposition the current offer for a different job-to-be-done" | Usually market development | Market or mission changed; product may need adaptation |

## Output Template

Use this compact table when the user needs a direct answer.

| Option | Quadrant | Product change | Market change | Strategic distance | Key assumptions | Evidence needed | Next method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Market penetration / market development / product development / diversification | Existing/new/adapted | Existing/new/adjacent | Low/medium/high | | | |

Then add:

```text
Best near-term learning move:
Highest-upside but highest-uncertainty move:
No-go trigger:
Recommended next validation:
```

## Quality Checks

Before presenting an Ansoff analysis, verify:

- The current product and current market baseline are explicit.
- Every option is classified by product novelty and market novelty, not by ambition or attractiveness.
- Market development and product development are not swapped.
- Diversification risk is not understated.
- Each option has at least one evidence need or assumption.
- The answer distinguishes classification from recommendation.
- The output routes to a downstream method when the user asks which option to choose.
- No private user or customer data is introduced into examples.

## Failure Modes

| Failure | What it looks like | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Quadrant as recommendation | "Diversification is best because it has the most growth potential" | Separate classification from attractiveness, feasibility, and value |
| Missing baseline | The answer labels a move "new market" without saying new relative to whom | Define current product and market first |
| Axis swap | New product for existing customers is called market development | Reclassify by product novelty and market novelty |
| Risk oversimplification | "Market penetration is safe; diversification is risky" | State risk drivers and evidence needs for this actor |
| Product-market blur | A channel change, geography change, and feature change are treated as one option | Split into separate options or name the mixed assumption |
| Portfolio confusion | Business units are scored by market growth and relative share | Route portfolio allocation work away from Ansoff |
| Valuation leap | The matrix recommends investment without a financial or expected-value method | Hand off to Expected Value, DCF, or another valuation method when value must be quantified |
