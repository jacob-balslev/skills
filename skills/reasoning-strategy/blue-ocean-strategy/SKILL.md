## Concept of the skill

**What it is:** Blue Ocean Strategy is W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne's market-creating strategy method. It helps an agent design value innovation by breaking from head-to-head competition and reconstructing market boundaries, buyer utility, price, and cost around a new value curve.

**Mental model:** Start with the industry's current strategy canvas, then ask which factors buyers receive and which factors the industry overfunds. Use six paths and noncustomer analysis to find demand outside the accepted boundary. Use eliminate, reduce, raise, and create choices to design a value curve that is meaningfully different and commercially viable.

**Why it exists:** Agents often say "blue ocean" when they mean niche positioning, feature differentiation, or cheaper pricing. This skill forces the answer to show the mechanism of new demand creation.

**What it is NOT:** It is not Five Forces, Seven Powers, Playing to Win, SWOT, generic innovation brainstorming, or a moat claim.

**Adjacent concepts:** value innovation, strategy canvas, value curve, Four Actions Framework, ERRC grid, six paths, buyer utility, noncustomers, price corridor, adoption hurdles.

**One-line analogy:** Blue Ocean Strategy redraws the game board rather than playing harder on the existing one.

**Common misconception:** A blue ocean is not merely "different." It must create a leap in buyer value while changing the cost structure enough that the strategy is viable.

# Blue Ocean Strategy

## Coverage

This skill teaches agents to:

1. Separate Blue Ocean Strategy from generic differentiation, low-cost competition, and competitor avoidance.
2. Draw the current strategy canvas and identify the industry's accepted factors of competition.
3. Use the six paths framework to reconstruct market boundaries.
4. Look beyond current customers to the three tiers of noncustomers.
5. Use buyer utility to find utility blocks and demand-expansion opportunities.
6. Apply the Four Actions Framework and ERRC grid to create a new value curve.
7. Test value innovation against utility, strategic price, target cost, and adoption hurdles.
8. Translate the analysis into a clear strategic profile, risks, and next evidence requests.

## Philosophy of the skill

Blue Ocean Strategy is useful because it makes innovation accountable to both value and economics. A creative idea is not enough. A lower price is not enough. A new segment is not enough. The method asks whether the offering changes what buyers value, removes costly assumptions from the old category, reaches latent demand, and can be delivered with a coherent profit logic.

The skill should make an agent less impressed by novelty and more disciplined about reconstruction. The goal is not to ignore competitors; it is to understand the old competitive logic well enough to escape it on purpose.

## Workflow

### 1. Define the current red-ocean frame

State the category before changing it.

```text
Industry or category:
Geography or channel:
Current buyer group:
Current competitors and alternatives:
Current factors of competition:
Current cost drivers:
Current noncustomers:
```

If the category is too broad, narrow it before drawing the strategy canvas. "Healthcare", "AI tools", or "education" is too broad for useful factor-level analysis.

### 2. Draw the strategy canvas

List the factors the industry competes on and invests in, then compare the current offering, major rivals, and alternatives.

| Factor of competition | Industry emphasis | Our current level | Alternative level | Buyer value evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Price | high / medium / low | | | |
| Convenience | high / medium / low | | | |
| Trust or risk reduction | high / medium / low | | | |
| Speed | high / medium / low | | | |
| Customization | high / medium / low | | | |

Use factors buyers can recognize. Internal activities such as "machine learning pipeline quality" only belong on the canvas if buyers directly experience them as utility, price, risk, speed, simplicity, status, or reliability.

### 3. Search across the six paths

Use the six paths to find new demand by changing the lens.

| Path | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Alternative industries | What do buyers use to solve the same job outside this industry? |
| Strategic groups | What trade-offs separate premium, mid-market, and low-cost groups? |
| Buyer groups | Who buys, uses, influences, maintains, or pays, and what changes if the target buyer shifts? |
| Complementary offerings | What happens before, during, or after use that shapes value? |
| Functional-emotional orientation | Is the category over-indexed on function when emotion matters, or the reverse? |
| Time | Which trends are irreversible enough to reshape value before the industry catches up? |

Do not present all six paths as equal. Name the one or two paths with the strongest evidence.

### 4. Look to noncustomers

Blue oceans usually come from demand beyond current loyal buyers.

| Tier | Who they are | Useful question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First tier | Buyers on the edge who minimally use the category and may leave | What makes them tolerate the category rather than love it? |
| Second tier | Buyers who consciously refuse the category | What barrier, trade-off, price, complexity, or risk makes them opt out? |
| Third tier | Buyers distant from the current category | What alternative job, context, or constraint keeps them outside the market definition? |

Current-customer feedback can improve the red ocean. Noncustomer insight is what can reshape demand.

### 5. Apply eliminate, reduce, raise, and create

Turn insight into a new value curve.

| Action | Question | Good answer | Weak answer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Eliminate | Which accepted factors should disappear? | Removes costly features, rituals, channels, or complexity buyers do not value | Removes anything expensive without checking utility |
| Reduce | Which factors should fall below industry standard? | Lowers over-served factors that do not drive demand | Cuts quality where buyers still care |
| Raise | Which factors should rise above industry standard? | Lifts utility, trust, access, speed, or simplicity in a way buyers notice | Raises every factor and inflates cost |
| Create | Which factors should appear for the first time? | Adds a new utility source that unlocks noncustomers | Adds novelty without demand evidence |

The ERRC grid is not a brainstorm list. It must produce a new strategic profile that is divergent, focused, and easy to explain.

### 6. Test commercial viability

Do not stop at a novel value curve.

```text
Buyer utility:
- What utility block is removed?
- Which buyer experience stage improves?
- Which noncustomer tier becomes reachable?

Strategic price:
- What price opens mass demand or a larger market?
- Which alternative sets the price reference?

Target cost:
- Which eliminated or reduced factors fund the new curve?
- What operating model makes the price profitable?

Adoption:
- What buyer, partner, channel, employee, or regulator resistance could block the move?
- What must be true for adoption to work?
```

A move that increases value but cannot hit target cost is not value innovation. A move that lowers cost but does not unlock buyer utility is low-cost competition.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Competitor benchmarking with a blue-ocean label | It optimizes the old factors of competition | Start with the strategy canvas, then reconstruct factors |
| Raise/create only | It increases buyer value but usually raises cost | Add eliminate/reduce moves that fund the new curve |
| Cost cutting only | It lowers cost without creating new demand | Tie reductions to buyer utility and noncustomer conversion |
| Current-customer-only research | It improves current demand instead of unlocking latent demand | Analyze all three tiers of noncustomers |
| Novelty as strategy | New features are not value innovation by themselves | Test utility, price, cost, and adoption |
| Six paths as loose brainstorming | The framework becomes a creativity prompt | Show which boundary is reconstructed and why it matters |

## Boundaries

Use Blue Ocean Strategy when the task is to create new demand through value innovation.

Use another tool when the task is narrower:

| Need | Better owner |
| --- | --- |
| Industry attractiveness, bargaining power, entrants, substitutes, rivalry | `porters-five-forces` |
| Durable moat source classification | `seven-powers` |
| Integrated choices across aspiration, arena, advantage, capabilities, systems | `playing-to-win` |
| Choosing among strategy frameworks | `framework-fit-analysis` |
| Ranking a known list of initiatives | `prioritization` |
| Designing verification gates for a process | `methodology` |

## Verification

Before finishing, verify:

- [ ] The current industry/category and factors of competition are explicit.
- [ ] The answer includes a current strategy canvas or value-curve comparison.
- [ ] At least one six-path lens is used to reconstruct a market boundary.
- [ ] Noncustomers are considered, not only current customers.
- [ ] The ERRC grid includes eliminate, reduce, raise, and create moves.
- [ ] The proposed curve is focused and divergent, not "raise everything."
- [ ] Buyer utility, strategic price, target cost, and adoption hurdles are tested.
- [ ] The answer labels assumptions and evidence gaps.
- [ ] The response does not present ordinary differentiation, low price, Five Forces, Seven Powers, OKRs, or a Playing to Win cascade as Blue Ocean Strategy.
