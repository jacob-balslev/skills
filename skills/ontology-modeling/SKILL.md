# Ontology Modeling

## Coverage

Formalize domain meaning into classes, properties, constraints, and axioms. Covers class hierarchy, object/data properties, domain/range, cardinality constraints, equivalence, disjointness, identity, controlled vocabularies, validation shapes, and interop-oriented JSON-LD/RDF projection. The output may be an actual ontology file or a precise ontology sketch before implementation.

## Philosophy

Ontology modeling is only worth its cost when ambiguity, interoperability, validation, or reasoning matter. Most teams do not need OWL. They need clear conceptual models and controlled vocabularies. Escalate to ontology when another consumer must compute over the semantics, validate instances against constraints, or align meaning across systems.

The ontology must preserve business meaning while stating which inferences are allowed. A vague ontology is worse than no ontology because it gives false confidence to downstream tools.

## Method

1. Identify competency questions: what must the ontology answer or validate?
2. Separate classes, instances, and literals.
3. Define properties with domain, range, direction, and cardinality where needed.
4. Add equivalence and disjointness only when the claim is durable.
5. Reuse existing vocabularies where they fit; do not rename standards for style.
6. Validate against positive and negative instance examples.
7. Document open-world vs closed-world assumptions.

## Verification

- [ ] Every class exists to answer a competency question
- [ ] Property domain and range are explicit where consumers depend on them
- [ ] Disjointness claims are intentional and tested with counterexamples
- [ ] Synonyms are aliases, not duplicate classes
- [ ] The model distinguishes class, instance, and literal values
- [ ] Validation examples include invalid cases
- [ ] Reasoning assumptions are stated

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `taxonomy-design` | You need a human-governed category tree or facets, not formal axioms. |
| `conceptual-modeling` | You are still discovering business entities and relationships with stakeholders. |
| `data-modeling` | You need persistence schema, keys, indexes, or denormalization decisions. |
| `semantic-relations` | You only need to choose the relation type between concepts. |
