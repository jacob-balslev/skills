# Transaction Isolation

## Coverage

The I axis of ACID — the property and operational choice that determines what concurrent transactions can observe of each other. Covers the five practical levels (read uncommitted, read committed, repeatable read, snapshot isolation, serializable), the anomalies each admits (dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads, lost updates, write skew, read-only-transaction anomalies), the Berenson et al. (1995) critique that exposed the SQL standard's looseness, the two dominant implementation mechanisms (two-phase locking and MVCC), Postgres's Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI), and the choice procedure: enumerate the anomalies the workload cannot tolerate, choose the lowest level that prevents them.

## Philosophy

Isolation is the most-mis-defaulted and most-mis-understood part of ACID. The standard's level names are not universal across databases; the level the team thinks they're running may not be the one the database actually provides; the workload's vulnerability to specific anomalies determines the required level — and most teams don't enumerate that vulnerability before choosing.

The discipline is to make the choice explicit, per transaction, against a named anomaly set. "Default to serializable for safety" is over-conservative; "default to read committed for performance" is under-safe; "this workload has invariants across rows that are vulnerable to write skew under SI, so this transaction runs at serializable" is the discipline.

The implementation matters as much as the level. A team running on Postgres at "serializable" is using SSI, with commit-time aborts that require retry-loop logic; a team running on MySQL InnoDB at "repeatable read" is getting gap-lock-prevented phantoms unlike the standard. Knowing the specific database's implementation of the chosen level is operational hygiene.

## The Anomaly Catalog

| Anomaly | What it is | Eliminated by |
|---|---|---|
| Dirty read | Reading uncommitted data from another transaction | Read committed and above |
| Non-repeatable read | Same row, different values within transaction | Repeatable read and above |
| Phantom read | Same range query, different result set | Serializable (and some RR implementations) |
| Lost update | Read-modify-write race between two transactions | Serializable; mitigated by SELECT FOR UPDATE |
| Write skew | Two transactions act on a snapshot; jointly violate an invariant | Serializable / SSI |
| Read-only transaction anomaly | Read-only transaction produces inconsistent output | SSI |

The discipline is reading this table for the workload at hand: which of these anomalies, if they occurred, would produce a correctness bug? Pick the lowest level that prevents those.

## Level vs Implementation Matrix

| Level (standard) | Postgres | MySQL InnoDB | SQL Server | Oracle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Read Uncommitted | Same as read committed | Available; dirty reads | Available | Same as read committed |
| Read Committed | Default; MVCC | Available | Default | Default; MVCC |
| Repeatable Read | MVCC; phantoms allowed | Default; gap locks prevent phantoms | Available; lock-based | Same as serializable |
| Snapshot Isolation | Not directly named (RR is SI-like) | n/a | RCSI option | Default-equivalent |
| Serializable | SSI (since 9.1) | Lock-based | Lock-based with range locks | Snapshot + checks |

Naming is not consistent; reading the database's documentation is required.

## The Choice Procedure

1. **Enumerate the workload's anomaly vulnerabilities.** For each transaction class: which anomalies would produce a correctness bug if they occurred? (A balance-decrement is vulnerable to lost updates. A doctor-on-call check is vulnerable to write skew. A read-only report is vulnerable to non-repeatable reads if cross-table consistency matters.)

2. **Find the lowest level that prevents the named anomalies.** Walk the anomaly catalog upward. Stop at the level that prevents all vulnerabilities.

3. **Verify the database's implementation actually prevents what the standard says it should.** Read the specific database's documentation; don't assume the standard's table is what your database does.

4. **Add explicit locking where the level alone is insufficient.** `SELECT FOR UPDATE`, advisory locks, and optimistic-concurrency tokens are tools for targeted correctness without raising the whole transaction's isolation level.

5. **Handle the retry-required failure modes.** SSI can abort transactions at commit; the application must retry. Repeatable read can throw serialization errors; the application must handle. Higher isolation introduces new failure modes, not zero failure modes.

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] The team can name the database's default isolation level and the level's implementation mechanism (MVCC, SSI, locking). Default assumption is not relied on.
- [ ] For each transaction class, the team has enumerated the anomaly vulnerabilities and chosen an isolation level that prevents them. Levels are not picked by reflex.
- [ ] Explicit locking (SELECT FOR UPDATE, advisory locks) is used where targeted correctness is needed without upgrading the whole transaction.
- [ ] Application code that runs at SSI or repeatable-read with serialization errors has retry-on-conflict logic. Higher isolation's failure modes are handled, not ignored.
- [ ] Write skew vulnerability is recognized for transactions that read X and write Y based on it under SI; either the level is upgraded to serializable or explicit locking guards the read set.
- [ ] Read-only transactions that join multiple tables run at at least repeatable read or snapshot isolation when cross-table consistency matters.
- [ ] The specific database's documentation has been consulted, not the SQL standard's level names. The team knows the specific anomaly set the level actually prevents.
- [ ] Isolation-level changes in production are treated as behavior changes, not config changes. New failure modes are handled before the change rolls.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Explaining the broader ACID frame | `acid-fundamentals` | acid-fundamentals owns the four-property frame; this owns the I axis |
| Reasoning about replica agreement across nodes | `cap-theorem-tradeoffs` | CAP is the distributed-systems frame; this is the single-cluster transactional frame |
| Tuning a slow query's performance | `query-optimization` | query-optimization owns performance; this owns concurrency correctness |
| Choosing an index for a query | `indexing-strategy` | indexing owns retrieval performance; this owns concurrent execution |
| Designing schema and access patterns | `data-modeling` | data-modeling owns design; this owns the concurrency contract |
| Coordinating across multiple transactions or services | sagas / distributed locks (out of this skill's scope) | cross-transaction coordination is a different problem |
