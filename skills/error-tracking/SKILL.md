# Error Tracking

## Coverage

- The four error-capture surfaces every application has, whether by design or accident: component-level boundaries, route-level fallbacks, application-global crash handler, and manual reporting from non-UI code paths
- The centralized-wrapper pattern: a thin module (`reportError`, `reportMessage`, `addBreadcrumb`, `setUser`, `clearUser`, `isErrorTrackingEnabled`) that sits between application code and the tracker SDK
- PII sanitization before any external send: a `sanitizePII()` pass over every payload, the rule that internal IDs are sent and email / name / phone are not, and the verification that wrapper-time sanitization is the actual scrubber (not the tracker SDK's `beforeSend`, which is a backstop at best)
- Environment-aware gating: dev mode emits to a local logger, production emits to the tracker; the gate is a single function so testing is trivial
- User context: setting and clearing `userId`, `orgId`, `role` (or equivalent) at session boundaries; the object signature versus positional-arg trap
- Error breadcrumbs: how to add navigation, network, and state context to events without leaking sensitive data
- Diagnostic discipline: the question *"does this layer actually report, or does it only log?"* — most route-level fallbacks log locally and never reach the tracker unless wired up explicitly
- Catastrophic-failure path: app-global handler bypasses the wrapper and goes straight to the SDK because the wrapper itself may have failed

## Philosophy

Most production applications develop an error-tracking architecture by accident, one try/catch at a time. The accumulated result is unprincipled: some errors reach the tracker with full PII, some are silently swallowed, some are double-reported (once by the boundary, once by the catch), and the dev-prod gating is per-call instead of central. The first time someone has to audit it — usually after a customer reports their email appearing in a third-party error dashboard — the cost of repair is enormous because every call site has to be revisited.

The discipline is to *centralize*. Application code never imports the tracker SDK directly; it imports a thin wrapper module. The wrapper owns three concerns: sanitization, environment gating, and signature stability. Sanitization runs on every payload before any external call. Environment gating decides whether the call goes to a local logger or to the tracker SDK. Signature stability means the wrapper's API does not change when the underlying tracker is swapped — application code is insulated from vendor decisions.

The second principle is *layering*. Errors arrive through multiple surfaces and each layer is responsible for a different recovery story. Component boundaries catch render-time and effect-time exceptions in a subtree and show a fallback UI. Route boundaries catch errors in a specific route and let other routes keep working. The application-global handler catches everything else and shows a "something went wrong" screen. Manual reporting handles errors caught in non-UI code (background jobs, server actions, async event handlers). Each layer must report — the question to verify on every change is *"does this layer's catch path actually call the wrapper, or does it only log locally?"* The default for many framework-provided fallbacks is the latter.

The third principle is *internal IDs only*. The tracker is operated by a third party. Even with a strict DPA, sending email addresses or names is a privacy escalation that has no justification — internal user and org IDs are sufficient to identify the affected account and let an engineer query application logs for the rest. PII appears in error payloads usually as a side effect of "let's just dump the request body" — `sanitizePII()` is the single chokepoint that catches this.

## The Four Error-Capture Surfaces

```
Surface 1: Component-level boundary
  React `ErrorBoundary` / Vue `errorCaptured` / Svelte error store
  Catches render-time and effect-time exceptions in the subtree
  Path: catch -> sanitize -> wrapper -> dev logger or tracker

Surface 2: Route-level boundary
  Next.js `error.tsx` / Remix `ErrorBoundary` / Nuxt `error.vue`
  Catches per-route errors and shows route-scoped recovery UI
  Path: framework hook -> shared fallback component -> wrapper
  (Many framework-provided fallbacks ONLY log locally; verify they call the wrapper)

Surface 3: Application-global crash handler
  Next.js `global-error.tsx` / framework-equivalent root handler
  Catches anything that escaped the route layer
  Path: bypasses wrapper and calls tracker SDK directly
  (The wrapper itself may have failed; rely only on the SDK at this layer)

Surface 4: Manual reporting (non-UI paths)
  Background jobs, server actions, async handlers, queue workers
  Path: try / catch -> wrapper.reportError(error, { tags, extra })
```

When extending or auditing the architecture, walk all four surfaces. The most common gap is Surface 2 — a route fallback shipped that renders a recovery UI but never calls `reportError`, so the production tracker shows zero events for that route while users see "something went wrong."

## The Centralized Wrapper

The wrapper module is small. Six functions cover most needs:

```typescript
// error-tracker.ts

import { tracker } from 'your-tracker-sdk';
import { sanitizePII } from './pii-sanitizer';
import { logger } from './logger';

const enabled = isProductionEnv() && hasTrackerDsn();

export function isErrorTrackingEnabled(): boolean {
  return enabled;
}

export function reportError(
  error: Error | string,
  context?: { tags?: Record<string, string>; extra?: unknown; level?: 'fatal' | 'error' | 'warning' }
): void {
  const sanitized = context?.extra ? sanitizePII(context.extra) : undefined;

  if (!enabled) {
    logger.error(error, { ...context, extra: sanitized });
    return;
  }

  tracker.captureException(error, {
    tags: context?.tags,
    contexts: sanitized ? { sanitized } : undefined,
    level: context?.level ?? 'error',
  });
}

export function reportMessage(
  message: string,
  context?: { tags?: Record<string, string>; extra?: unknown; level?: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error' }
): void {
  const sanitized = context?.extra ? sanitizePII(context.extra) : undefined;

  if (!enabled) {
    logger[context?.level ?? 'info'](message, { ...context, extra: sanitized });
    return;
  }

  tracker.captureMessage(message, {
    tags: context?.tags,
    contexts: sanitized ? { sanitized } : undefined,
    level: context?.level ?? 'info',
  });
}

export function setUser(user: { userId?: string; orgId?: string; role?: string } | null): void {
  if (!enabled) return;
  tracker.setUser(user);
}

export function clearUser(): void {
  if (!enabled) return;
  tracker.setUser(null);
}

export function addBreadcrumb(
  category: string,
  message: string,
  data?: unknown,
  level?: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error'
): void {
  const sanitized = data ? sanitizePII(data) : undefined;
  if (!enabled) {
    logger.debug(`[breadcrumb:${category}] ${message}`, sanitized);
    return;
  }
  tracker.addBreadcrumb({ category, message, data: sanitized, level: level ?? 'info' });
}
```

Every application code path uses these functions; nothing imports the tracker SDK directly *except* the application-global crash handler (which is the one place where the wrapper itself may have crashed).

## PII Sanitization

`sanitizePII()` is the chokepoint. It is the *only* point at which payloads are scrubbed; the tracker SDK's `beforeSend` hook is a backstop, not the primary defence. Wrapping at the SDK level alone misses everything that flows through `breadcrumb` and `extra` outside the exception flow.

```typescript
// pii-sanitizer.ts (sketch)
const PII_KEY_PATTERNS = [
  /^email$/i, /^e_mail$/i,
  /^phone$/i, /^phone_number$/i,
  /^name$/i, /^first_name$/i, /^last_name$/i, /^full_name$/i,
  /^address$/i, /^street$/i, /^postal_code$/i,
  /^ssn$/i, /^tax_id$/i,
  /token/i, /secret/i, /password/i, /api_key/i,
];

export function sanitizePII(value: unknown, depth = 0): unknown {
  if (depth > 6) return '[max-depth]';
  if (value === null || value === undefined) return value;
  if (typeof value !== 'object') return value;
  if (Array.isArray(value)) return value.map(v => sanitizePII(v, depth + 1));

  const out: Record<string, unknown> = {};
  for (const [k, v] of Object.entries(value)) {
    if (PII_KEY_PATTERNS.some(re => re.test(k))) {
      out[k] = '[redacted]';
    } else {
      out[k] = sanitizePII(v, depth + 1);
    }
  }
  return out;
}
```

The patterns and the recursion bound are workload-specific; tune to your domain. The non-negotiable property is that *every* path into the wrapper passes through `sanitizePII` — there is no "trusted" call site.

## User Context

User context is set at the moment a session is established and cleared on sign-out. The signature is an object, not positional arguments — positional args break silently when one of the optional fields shifts position.

```typescript
// On sign-in or session restore
setUser({
  userId: session.user.id,
  orgId: session.user.orgId,
  role: session.user.role,
});

// On sign-out
clearUser();
```

What goes in: stable internal identifiers (UUIDs, role enums). What does *not* go in: email, full name, phone, IP address, anything that could identify a real person to a tracker operator who already has their own customer database.

For a multi-tenant application, the `orgId` is essential — it scopes the error to a specific customer organization, lets you query "show me all errors for tenant X," and makes incident response actually possible. Without `orgId`, every error event is anonymous and a tenant-affecting bug looks like a fleet-wide problem.

## Environment-Aware Gating

The gating decision lives in one place: `isErrorTrackingEnabled()`. Two conditions: production-equivalent environment *and* tracker DSN configured. If either is missing, every wrapper call falls through to the local logger.

```typescript
function isProductionEnv(): boolean {
  return process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
}

function hasTrackerDsn(): boolean {
  return Boolean(process.env.TRACKER_DSN ?? process.env.SENTRY_DSN ?? process.env.ROLLBAR_TOKEN);
}
```

The benefit is that *every test* exercises the same wrapper and the same sanitization path as production, except the final hop hits a logger instead of a tracker. Tests can assert on logger output to verify what *would* have been sent. Without this gating, tests either use a mock tracker (which drifts from production behavior) or skip the path entirely (which means PII leaks slip through CI).

## Diagnostic Discipline

The single most useful question when auditing or extending the architecture:

> *"Does this layer actually call the wrapper, or does it only log locally?"*

Many framework-provided error fallbacks render a recovery UI and call a console-level logger but never report the event externally. From a user perspective the recovery feels graceful; from an operator perspective the production tracker shows zero events for that route, and a regression that fires the boundary 1000 times an hour is invisible.

The audit:

1. List every error-capture surface in the application (the four-surface model above).
2. For each surface, find the actual code path: which file owns the catch, what does it do with the error?
3. Confirm each path calls `reportError` (or, for Surface 3, the SDK directly with sanitization).
4. For surfaces that only log: decide whether they *should* report, and wire them up if so.

A common output of this audit: "47 routes have `error.tsx` files; 12 of them inherit a shared fallback that does report; 35 inherit a different shared fallback that only logs; we have been blind to errors on those 35 routes for a year."

## Evals

This skill ships a comprehension-eval artifact at [`examples/evals/error-tracking.json`](https://github.com/jacob-balslev/skill-graph/blob/main/examples/evals/error-tracking.json). The checklist below is the authoring gate for exception-reporting pipeline decisions; the eval file is the grader surface.

## Verification

- [ ] All application code reports errors through the wrapper module; nothing imports the tracker SDK directly except the application-global crash handler
- [ ] Every wrapper call passes payloads through `sanitizePII` before any external send
- [ ] User context uses internal IDs (`userId`, `orgId`, `role`); no email, name, phone, or address
- [ ] `isErrorTrackingEnabled()` is the single environment gate; dev mode falls through to the local logger
- [ ] Component boundaries (Surface 1) catch and call the wrapper
- [ ] Route fallbacks (Surface 2) explicitly call the wrapper — verify, do not assume
- [ ] Application-global handler (Surface 3) calls the SDK directly with its own sanitization (the wrapper may have crashed)
- [ ] Non-UI code (Surface 4) wraps async paths in try/catch and calls `reportError`
- [ ] Breadcrumbs are added at meaningful state transitions (route change, network call, mutation), with sanitization
- [ ] At least one regression test exercises a forced error and asserts the wrapper was called with sanitized data
- [ ] At least one regression test exercises an unconfigured environment and asserts the wrapper falls through to the logger

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `a11y` | Designing accessible error-message copy, focus management on the recovery UI, or screen-reader announcements |
| `debugging` | Root-causing a single observed error already captured in the tracker |
| `documentation` | Writing the contributor-docs page that explains the error-tracking architecture |
| `code-review` | Reviewing an AI-generated error handler for correctness |
| `testing-strategy` | Deciding whether a new error path warrants an integration regression test |
| `owasp-security` | Designing the broader PII storage, retention, and credential-handling policy across the system |
| `refactor` | Reorganizing the error-helper module while preserving its current behavior |
