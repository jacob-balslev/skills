# Codex

## Concept of the skill

**What it is:** Codex is OpenAI's terminal-first agent harness that drives a frontier GPT model (the GPT-5.5 generation). It is the GPT-running counterpart to Claude Code, with its own differentiators: resumable sessions, non-interactive `exec` piping, sandbox permission modes, MCP, on-demand subagents, and a `/review` code-review agent.

**Mental model:** Same harness-vs-model split as any agent CLI — Codex is the *body*, a frontier GPT is the *brain*. What makes Codex distinct among bodies is statefulness: a session is a durable object holding transcript, plan, and approvals that you can resume by ID, plus an `exec` mode that pipes results to stdout for scripting and in-process dispatch.

**Why it exists:** To operate a codebase with a GPT model under a controllable permission boundary, while making runs *resumable and scriptable* — so a long task can be continued across invocations (keeping its plan and approval history) and automated into pipelines instead of restarting cold every time.

**What it is NOT:** It is not the GPT model itself (the model is selectable inside Codex via `/model`), not the OpenAI SDK/API, and not the Claude Code harness — choosing Codex is a harness decision distinct from the GPT-vs-Claude model-routing decision.

**Adjacent concepts:** Claude Code (the rival harness), `gpt-5-5` (the model-routing decision for the GPT the harness runs), the OpenAI API (the SDK surface), and generic resumable-loop patterns (the topology underneath).

**One-line analogy:** Codex is a cockpit with a flight recorder and autopilot resume — you can land, walk away, and later climb back into the exact same flight with its plan and clearances intact.

**Common misconception:** That resuming a Codex session means re-pasting context into a fresh run. It does not — `codex exec resume <SESSION_ID>` reuses the stored transcript, plan, and approvals; cold one-shots that re-send full context every turn waste tokens and discard that state.

## Coverage

- The harness-selection decision: when to run a piece of work in the Codex CLI versus the Claude Code harness
- Scoping work to Codex's native capabilities: resumable `codex exec resume` sessions, non-interactive `exec` stdout-piping, in-process dispatch, `/permissions` sandbox modes, MCP connectors, on-demand subagents, the `/review` code-review agent, `/model` switching
- The threaded-consultation pattern: holding a session across turns by capturing and resuming a session id instead of cold one-shots
- The known failure modes to avoid: non-autonomous subagents, Full-Access network/cross-machine reach, and cold-one-shot context/plan loss
- The boundary against adjacent skills: GPT-vs-Claude model routing (the model, not the harness), the rival Claude Code harness, the OpenAI/Anthropic SDK surface, and generic resumable-loop design
- What this skill is NOT: the GPT model itself, the OpenAI SDK/API, or the Claude Code harness

## Philosophy of the skill

The harness and the model are two separate decisions, and conflating them is the most common error this skill guards against. Choosing Codex is a statement about the *body* — its statefulness, scriptability, permission boundary, and operating surface — not about the brain it happens to run; the model is selectable inside it. The opinionated stance is that statefulness is the differentiator worth optimizing for: a session that durably holds transcript, plan, and approvals turns long multi-step work from a sequence of cold restarts into one continuable flow, and an `exec` mode that pipes to stdout turns an interactive agent into a scriptable pipeline component. The corollary discipline is to treat the harness's powerful modes as boundaries, not conveniences — Full Access is a deliberate escalation, subagents are an explicit request, and a resume is always preferred over re-priming.

## When to use Codex (routing decision)

Reach for Codex when the task wants its **statefulness, scriptability, or GPT lane**, and the work lives in a real repo:

| Want this | Why Codex fits |
|---|---|
| Continue a prior run keeping its plan + approvals | **Resumable sessions** — `codex resume` / `codex exec resume <ID>` |
| A scripted, threaded, automatable GPT consultation | **`exec` stdout-piping** + resume-by-id (the threaded-consultation pattern) |
| In-process GPT dispatch (vs a visible external spawn) | `exec` powers in-process dispatch (e.g. the `codex:codex-rescue` subagent) |
| A controllable permission boundary | **`/permissions`** — Auto / Read-only / Full Access |
| A dedicated diff review pass | **`/review`** — prioritized, actionable findings |
| Real CLI/terminal-heavy iteration | The GPT it runs leads Terminal-Bench 2.0 (82.7%) |

Choose Claude Code instead when the task wants Claude Code's richer native extensibility, plan mode, or Opus's architecture edge — see the boundary table.

## Capability surface

| Feature | What it gives you | When it earns its keep |
|---|---|---|
| `codex resume` / `exec resume <ID>` / `--last` / `--all` | Resume a session by id/most-recent, across any dir | Multi-step work continued without re-priming context |
| `exec` (non-interactive) | Pipes final plan + results to stdout | Scripting, pipelines, in-process dispatch |
| `/permissions` (Auto / Read-only / Full Access) | Sandbox boundary for the agent's actions | Gating destructive or networked actions |
| MCP (`~/.codex/config.toml`, `codex mcp`) | External tool/data connectors | Capabilities with no native CLI |
| Subagents (`[agents]` in config) | Parallel sub-work — **explicit request only** | Fan-out you deliberately invoke (never assume auto) |
| `/review` | Dedicated diff-review agent | A focused review pass with ranked findings |
| `/model` | Switch GPT model / reasoning level mid-session | Tuning the model/effort to the task |
| `--cd` / `--add-dir` | Steer the environment before resuming | Pointing a resumed run at the right roots |

## Strengths and weaknesses

**Strengths**
- Durable, resumable sessions that retain transcript, plan, and approvals — uniquely strong for threaded, multi-step GPT work.
- `exec` stdout-piping makes it scriptable and dispatchable in-process.
- Runs a GPT that leads Terminal-Bench 2.0 — well-matched to its CLI operating surface.
- Explicit sandbox modes give a clear permission boundary.

**Weaknesses / failure modes**
- **Subagents are not autonomous** — Codex only spawns them when explicitly asked; do not assume automatic fan-out.
- **Full Access opens network + cross-machine reach** — a real safety boundary; default to Auto/Read-only and escalate deliberately.
- **Cold one-shots lose state** — re-sending full context instead of `exec resume <ID>` wastes tokens and discards the plan/approval history.
- Its GPT trails Claude Opus on complex multi-file resolution and broad architecture (a model fact that bleeds into harness choice for those task shapes).

## Verification

Use this checklist to confirm a Codex harness decision is correct and current.

- [ ] The decision was framed as a HARNESS choice (statefulness, scriptability, permission boundary, operating surface) — not as a model-routing decision in disguise
- [ ] For continued work, a resumable session (`codex resume` / `codex exec resume <ID>` / `--last`) is used instead of a cold one-shot that re-pastes context
- [ ] For automation/pipelines, the non-interactive `exec` (stdout-piping) path is used rather than the interactive TUI
- [ ] The permission mode was chosen deliberately: Auto/Read-only by default, Full Access only when network/cross-machine reach is genuinely required and its risk is accepted
- [ ] Subagent fan-out, if expected, is explicitly requested — the harness does NOT spawn subagents autonomously
- [ ] Command names, flags, and the served GPT generation were re-checked against current provider docs (the CLI ships features fast) before relying on a specific detail

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of `codex` | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Deciding whether GPT-5.5 or Claude should do the task | `gpt-5-5` | That is a MODEL-routing decision, orthogonal to the harness |
| Choosing/scoping the Claude Code harness | `claude-code` | The rival-harness decision |
| Writing code against the OpenAI/Anthropic API | `claude-api` (Anthropic) or the OpenAI SDK directly | That is application code, not harness selection |
| Designing a generic resumable/supervised agent loop | `autonomous-loop-patterns` | Loop topology below any specific harness |
