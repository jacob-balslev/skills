# Journey Mapping

## Coverage
Journey mapping covers the family of visualizations that lay out a user's experience as a timeline across stages, actions, thoughts, feelings, and touchpoints. The classic **customer journey map** (Jeff Patton's writing on story mapping is an adjacent influence; NN/g has codified the canonical structure) typically has a horizontal axis of stages (e.g., Awareness → Consideration → Purchase → Onboarding → Use → Renew/Churn) and vertical lanes for what the user is doing, thinking, feeling, and which touchpoint they are interacting with. An **emotional curve** rendered along the timeline highlights peaks and troughs — the "moments of truth" that disproportionately shape the overall impression.

A **service blueprint** (Lynn Shostack, 1984) extends the journey map downward with **front-stage** elements (what the user sees), the **line of visibility**, and **back-stage** elements (what employees, systems, and processes do that the user does not see). Below those, **support processes** show the infrastructure that enables back-stage work. Service blueprints are appropriate when the experience involves human or system handoffs that the user never sees but that determine whether the experience succeeds.

The skill also covers **current-state vs future-state** maps (current documents reality and surfaces pain points; future proposes a redesigned experience and is used to align stakeholders), and the choice of **scope** — a single transaction, an entire lifecycle, or a specific moment-of-truth blown up in detail. Granularity matches the decision the map will inform; a board-level alignment map is coarser than a redesign brief.

## Philosophy
Journey maps exist because experience is temporal and cross-channel, and most artifacts a team produces are neither. A screen design captures one moment; an architecture diagram captures one cross-section; a backlog captures one project. The journey map is the only artifact that asks "what does the user actually live through, end to end, including the parts that happen on phone calls, in physical mail, in the gap between sessions, and in the moments when they think about us and then put it down?"

The practice resists two failure modes. The first is the **anodyne happy-path map**, where every stage is labeled with a positive verb and the emotional curve is a gentle wave — these maps describe what the team hopes is true rather than what research showed. The second is the **everything-everywhere map**, where ambition outruns research and the map sprouts lanes for every possible channel without evidence. A journey map's credibility comes from being grounded in synthesis output; without that grounding it is decoration.

## Verification
- The map is grounded in specific research evidence — each pain point and emotional trough cites at least one source (interview quote, observation, support log) rather than being asserted.
- Stages on the horizontal axis are named from the user's perspective ("trying to understand what I owe") rather than the business's ("acquisition funnel stage 2").
- The emotional curve has actual lows, not only highs and neutrals — a curve with no dips usually means the map omits the hard parts.
- For service blueprints, the line of visibility is drawn explicitly and the back-stage steps include both human and system actors.
- The map identifies named **opportunity areas** at specific stages, not a generic "improve onboarding" annotation.
- A stakeholder who did not attend the mapping session can read the map and explain back the journey's overall arc, including where it goes wrong.

## Do NOT Use When
- The scope is a single screen or single task within one session — use **task-analysis** for goal-directed step decomposition.
- The team has not yet done qualitative research on the journey — run **user-research** and **research-synthesis** first; an unresearched journey map is fiction.
- The diagram needed is a system architecture, microservice topology, or data flow — those are engineering artifacts, not journey maps.
- The output should be a navigation structure or content taxonomy — use **information-architecture**.
- The task is modeling engineering domain events across bounded contexts — use **event-storming** or **bounded-context-mapping**.
- The team is in solutioning mode and needs to generate concept variants — use **ideation**; journey mapping clarifies experience, it does not invent new ones.
