# API Design

## Coverage

Design clear and evolvable API surfaces. Covers resources vs actions, route naming, request/response schemas, validation, status codes, pagination, filtering, sorting, idempotency, auth boundaries, error envelopes, rate-limit signals, versioning, deprecation, and contract examples.

## Philosophy

An API is a product surface for another program. Its main job is stable meaning under change. Internal convenience should not leak into routes, schemas, or errors unless consumers actually need it.

Prefer boring consistency. A small set of predictable patterns beats clever endpoint-specific behavior that every client has to rediscover.

## Method

1. Identify consumers and their tasks.
2. Model resources and actions separately.
3. Define request, response, and error schema examples.
4. Decide pagination, filtering, sorting, and field selection.
5. State auth, tenant, and permission boundaries.
6. Add idempotency and retry behavior for mutating or async operations.
7. Define versioning and deprecation rules before the first breaking change.
8. Add contract tests or fixtures.

## Evals

This skill ships a comprehension-eval artifact at [`examples/evals/api-design.json`](https://github.com/jacob-balslev/skill-graph/blob/main/examples/evals/api-design.json). The checklist below is the authoring gate for API surface decisions; the eval file is the grader surface.

## Verification

- [ ] Routes use consistent nouns/actions and avoid implementation leakage
- [ ] Request and response examples cover success and failure
- [ ] Status codes match retry and client-action semantics
- [ ] Collection endpoints define pagination and stable ordering
- [ ] Mutating operations define idempotency or explicitly reject it
- [ ] Auth and tenant boundaries are visible in the contract
- [ ] Breaking-change and deprecation rules are stated

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `system-interface-contracts` | The boundary is broader than an API endpoint, such as jobs, modules, events, or agent interfaces. |
| `event-contract-design` | You need asynchronous event schema, envelope, topic/channel naming, replay, or compatibility. |
| `data-modeling` | You need persistence structure and constraints. |
| `webhook-integration` | You are implementing inbound third-party webhook handling. |
| `debugging` | An API already fails and needs diagnosis. |
