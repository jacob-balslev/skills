# Event Storming

## Coverage

Discover domain behavior through temporal events and decisions. Covers domain events, commands, actors, policies, aggregates, read models, external systems, hotspots, timelines, invariants, and handoff into bounded-context, state-machine, data, and API design.

## Philosophy

Event storming starts from "what happened" because events expose real business flow faster than nouns do. Noun-first modeling often freezes premature assumptions. Event-first modeling reveals time, causality, policy, and exceptions.

Do not confuse domain events with technical notifications. "OrderPlaced" is business meaning. "WebhookReceived" is transport detail.

## Method

1. List domain events in past tense.
2. Place them on a timeline.
3. Add commands that cause events.
4. Add actors and external systems that issue commands or receive outcomes.
5. Add policies: "when event X happens, if condition Y, then command Z."
6. Identify aggregates that enforce invariants.
7. Mark hotspots, missing decisions, temporal ambiguity, and unclear ownership.
8. Hand off to bounded-context, state-machine, data, or API design only after the flow is coherent.

## Verification

- [ ] Events are named in past tense and carry business meaning
- [ ] Commands are imperative and have actors or policies
- [ ] Policies are explicit condition-action rules
- [ ] Aggregates are tied to invariants, not guessed from nouns
- [ ] External systems and transport details are separated from domain events
- [ ] Hotspots and unanswered questions are recorded
- [ ] The timeline can replay a real scenario end to end

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `webhook-integration` | You are implementing provider webhooks, signatures, retries, and deduplication. |
| `event-contract-design` | You already selected the event and need schema, envelope, topic, compatibility, replay, or fixtures. |
| `state-machine-modeling` | You already know the lifecycle and need formal states, transitions, and guards. |
| `data-modeling` | You need tables, keys, indexes, constraints, or data lifecycle. |
| `api-design` | You need endpoint, request, response, and status-code design. |
