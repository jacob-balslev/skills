# Problem Approach Router

## Coverage

Routes between the five foundational problem-solving skills by classifying the problem type before any approach is applied. Does not teach any methodology — it dispatches to the skill that teaches it. The routing table covers: novel problems with unknown assumptions (`first-principles-thinking`), recurring or familiar problem shapes (`pattern-recognition`), system-understanding and explanation tasks (`mental-models`), constraint-dominated or boundary-rich problems (`constraint-awareness`), and workflow and user-goal decomposition tasks (`task-analysis`).

## Routing Rules

Evaluate the problem against the signals below. The first matching row determines the skill to activate. If multiple rows match, the problem is multi-layered — apply the skills in the order they match (start from the top of the table).

| Signal | Route to | When to activate |
|---|---|---|
| "Nobody has solved this before" or "I don't know what the correct assumptions are" | `first-principles-thinking` | Problem is genuinely novel; existing solutions, patterns, and analogies are unavailable or misleading |
| "This looks like something I've seen before" or "there's a recurring shape here" | `pattern-recognition` | Problem shape has appeared before in the same or analogous form; the goal is to name and apply the pattern rather than derive from scratch |
| "I need to explain how this system works" or "I don't understand how the parts relate" | `mental-models` | Goal is comprehension or explanation of a domain, system, concept, or architecture — not yet solving or deciding |
| "Everything is constrained and I don't know which constraints are hard" | `constraint-awareness` | Problem is dominated by boundary conditions, limitations, or competing requirements; the first move is mapping what cannot change |
| "I need to decompose this workflow or user goal into steps" | `task-analysis` | Problem is a sequence of user actions, a multi-step workflow, or a task that requires understanding user intent before designing a solution |
| "I'm not sure which of the above applies" | `epistemic-grounding` | Start here when the problem type itself is unclear — epistemic-grounding clarifies what is known, what is assumed, and what is missing before routing |

### Coverage-gap behavior

If no signal matches clearly, return to the caller with: "Which of the following best describes the problem — novel/no-prior-solution, recurring/familiar, needs-explanation, constraint-dominated, workflow/user-goal?" Do NOT default to any approach without a classification signal.

### Compound problems

When a problem matches more than one row simultaneously (e.g., it is both novel AND constraint-dominated), list both matches and route to each skill in sequence. Declare the compound classification explicitly before proceeding: "This is a novel + constraint-dominated problem. I will apply first-principles-thinking first to clear the assumptions, then constraint-awareness to map the hard boundaries."

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `first-principles-thinking` | The approach is already known to be first-principles; the router has already been applied |
| `pattern-recognition` | The recurring pattern is already identified; no routing decision is needed |
| `mental-models` | The goal is explicitly system understanding; the routing decision is already made |
| `task-analysis` | The task is explicitly a workflow or user-goal decomposition; no routing needed |
| `epistemic-grounding` | The problem is not about choosing an approach but about clarifying what is known |
| Domain-specific skills (`debugging`, `testing-strategy`, `code-review`, etc.) | The problem is domain-specific and the correct skill is already evident from context |
