# Accessibility

## Coverage

- Semantic HTML: choosing the right primitive elements so structure is meaningful to assistive technology
- Keyboard access: making every interaction reachable and operable without a pointing device
- Focus management: keeping focus visible, predictable, and correctly placed after navigation and state changes
- Labeling and naming: ensuring every interactive element has a programmatic name that matches its visible label
- State and change announcement: communicating dynamic updates (loading, errors, success) to assistive technology
- Reduced-motion and high-contrast preferences: respecting user settings that affect interaction perception

## Philosophy

Accessible interaction is structural, not cosmetic. It is decided by the primitive you picked, the focus order you wrote, and the label that ships or doesn't — not by the audit that runs after. Teams that treat accessibility as a finishing pass pay for it twice: once in remediation work that was cheaper to avoid, and again when assistive-technology users hit the failure and bounce. The correct default is to build with those users in scope from the first commit, not after the first lawsuit.

## Primitive Selection

The single highest-leverage accessibility decision is picking the right HTML primitive before styling. A wrong primitive cannot be rescued by ARIA; the right primitive usually needs no ARIA at all.

| User intent                          | Correct primitive                               | Wrong primitives (common mistakes)                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trigger an action on the same page   | `<button type="button">`                        | `<a href="#">`, `<div onclick>`, `<span role="button">` |
| Navigate to a different URL          | `<a href="…">`                                  | `<button onclick=navigate>`, `<div onclick>`            |
| Group related form controls          | `<fieldset>` + `<legend>`                       | `<div>` with a heading above it                         |
| Label a form control                 | `<label for="…">` (or wrapping `<label>`)       | `<div>` text next to the input, `placeholder` only      |
| Show a collapsible section           | `<details>` + `<summary>`                       | `<div>` with JS toggle and no ARIA                      |
| Present tabular data                 | `<table>` + `<th scope="…">`                    | `<div>` grid, CSS grid with no semantic role            |
| Announce a status change             | `<output>` or `role="status"` live region       | Toast that only renders visually                        |
| Interactive widget not covered above | Native element + tested keyboard + ARIA pattern | Custom `<div>` with ad-hoc `role` and handlers          |

### When ARIA is appropriate

Only when no native primitive fits the interaction, and only when you also ship the keyboard behavior that matches the role. Adding `role="button"` to a `<div>` without Enter/Space handlers is worse than either the correct `<button>` or the untyped `<div>` alone.

## Evals

This skill ships a comprehension-eval artifact at [`examples/evals/a11y.json`](https://github.com/jacob-balslev/skill-graph/blob/main/examples/evals/a11y.json). The `Verification` checklist below is the authoring gate for a new interactive component; the eval file is how this skill is graded by `scripts/skill-audit.js --graded`. Do not conflate them — the checklist is for implementers, the eval is for the grader.

## Verification

- [ ] Interactive elements use the right semantic primitives
- [ ] Keyboard-only flows remain usable
- [ ] Focus is visible and lands in the correct place
- [ ] Labels and state changes are perceivable
- [ ] User preferences (reduced motion, high contrast) are respected

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead     | When                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `documentation` | The task is prose structure or reading-level clarity, not interaction accessibility                      |
| `refactor`      | The task is behavior-preserving code cleanup — refactoring does not change what assistive tech perceives |
