# Mental Models

## Coverage

The cognitive discipline of building, evaluating, and aligning the internal representations that minds carry of systems, domains, and interactions. Covers the three-model frame (designer model / system image / user model), the two gulfs (execution and evaluation), the role of analogy and metaphor in seeding new models, the model failure modes (transfer, overgeneralization, underspecification, drift, invariant blindness), the difference between surface, operational, architectural, and domain models, the methods for surfacing and repairing mental models through interface and documentation, and the cross-domain application of mental-models reasoning to UX, distributed systems, type systems, API design, and team collaboration.

## Philosophy

Mental models are how minds make systems tractable. Every user, every developer, every stakeholder operates from a model — partial, private, learned. Most surprise, most "confusing UX," most "miscommunication," most "user error" is the trace of a model-system gap. The disciplined response is to ask which model differs from which referent, where, and which intervention closes the gap — not to ask whose fault the surprise was.

The discipline holds three commitments. First: that the user, the developer, and the system are three distinct sources of truth, each with their own model, none of which is automatically right. Second: that the interface is the bridge through which the system's actual model can become visible enough to repair user models in flight. Third: that the right model for a role is the smallest model that supports successful action in that role — not the most complete model, not the most accurate model in some absolute sense, but the model that does the work and no more.

For agents working in software systems, mental-models discipline is the layer that decides what model to operate from before deciding what code to write. An agent that imports a wrong metaphor — "git branches are tree branches," "React state is OOP state," "a webhook is a function call" — produces code that compiles but doesn't work. The discipline is to make the operating model explicit, to test its predictions against the system, and to surface the gap before it becomes a bug.

## The Three-Model Frame

Norman's foundational distinction. Every system involves three models that may or may not align.

| Model | Held by | Built from | Failure mode when divergent |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Designer's model** | The builders | Intent, specs, internal docs | "I built it this way; why doesn't anyone get it?" — usually the system image fails to convey the designer's model |
| **System image** | The interface itself | Visual design, behavior, copy, feedback | An accurate system that looks wrong, or an inaccurate system that looks reasonable — both confuse users |
| **User's model** | Each user | Interface, prior experience, instruction | User takes actions that match their model but not the system; reports the system as buggy |

The interface is the only channel by which the designer's model can reach the user. If the interface is opaque, inconsistent, or contradicts the system's actual behavior, the user constructs the best model they can from incomplete signals — and that model will be wrong in predictable ways.

## The Two Gulfs

Norman's framework for where model failure shows up.

| Gulf | Question it asks | What widens it | What narrows it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Gulf of execution** | "How do I do what I want to do?" | Hidden affordances, non-discoverable commands, jargon controls | Direct manipulation, obvious primary action, learned conventions matched correctly |
| **Gulf of evaluation** | "What did the system actually do?" | Silent state changes, no feedback, ambiguous results | Immediate visible feedback, undo, state inspection, clear confirmations |

A wide gulf of execution means the user can't find the right action. A wide gulf of evaluation means they can't tell whether their action succeeded. Both are bridged by surfacing the system's state in a form the user's model can read.

## Model Failure Modes And Their Interventions

| Failure mode | What it looks like | Intervention |
|---|---|---|
| **Transfer failure** | User applies a model from another system whose details don't fit ("I tried to drag this row to reorder, like every other table") | Surface the difference explicitly: tooltip, copy, signifier change. Or implement the expected behavior. |
| **Overgeneralization** | A pattern that worked in one context applied beyond its scope ("I tried to click outside the dialog to dismiss; it was a modal that requires explicit choice") | Signal boundaries: visual cues, copy that names the constraint, behavioral signals |
| **Underspecification** | The user has a model that's silent on the case they hit ("I assumed undo would work everywhere; this action wasn't undoable") | Progressive disclosure of the relevant constraint at the moment of relevance, not in advance |
| **Drift** | A model that was once correct but no longer matches ("I learned this workflow last year; it has three new steps now") | Change communication: in-product release notes, prompts on first encounter with changed behavior, removal of stale documentation |
| **Invariant blindness** | The system has a rule the user doesn't know about ("you can edit this except when another user has it locked, and the lock isn't visible") | Surface the invariant at the moment of relevance: lock indicator, error message that names the rule, preflight check |

The right intervention depends on the right diagnosis. "Train the user harder" is almost never correct — the user's model came from somewhere, usually from the interface or precedent.

## Metaphor As Model-Seeding

A new mental model is most often constructed by analogy from an existing one. The chosen metaphor has long downstream effects.

| Metaphor | What it seeds | What it costs |
|---|---|---|
| File ⟶ paper-in-folder | Discrete unit; in one place; can be moved | Implies physical containment that cloud-sync, multi-tag, and shared-link systems violate |
| Email folder ⟶ filing cabinet | Mutually exclusive categories | Doesn't fit messages that belong in multiple buckets — tags model fits better |
| Web page ⟶ printed document | Static, paginated, top-to-bottom | Doesn't fit dynamic, interactive, scrollable, infinite-content pages |
| API call ⟶ function call | Synchronous, single-machine, return-immediately | Hides network failure, latency, retries, partial failure |
| Thread ⟶ worker | Independent unit; pauseable | Doesn't surface the shared-memory failure modes that cause actual concurrency bugs |
| Database transaction ⟶ all-or-nothing | Strong atomicity | Doesn't fit weaker isolation levels (Read Committed, etc.); see `transaction-isolation` |

Choosing a metaphor commits the designer to surfacing the points where it breaks down. The metaphor is useful precisely because of its match; it is dangerous precisely because of its mismatches.

## Applying The Discipline

| Domain | Question to ask |
|---|---|
| **Designing a feature** | What's the user's model now? What model do we want them to have? What's the smallest interface change that bridges the two? |
| **Naming a function or API** | What model does this name imply? Does the function actually behave that way? If not, rename or change behavior. |
| **Writing an error message** | What model fragment caused this error? What model would prevent it? Can the error message implant the corrective model? |
| **Onboarding a new user** | What metaphor will we seed? Will it still fit in 6 months when the user is fluent? |
| **Resolving team disagreement** | Are we disagreeing about the system, or about each member's model of the system? Compare models before debating decisions. |
| **Debugging a confusing codebase** | What model would make this code obvious? Why doesn't the code communicate that model? |
| **Working with an agent on a codebase** | What model is the agent operating from? What would it predict about this code? Does the prediction match reality? |
| **Architecting a distributed system** | What is the designer's model of consistency? What will the system actually exhibit? What's in the system image (logs, dashboards, error semantics) that lets operators build the right operational model? |

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] The system being designed, debugged, or discussed has the three models (designer / image / user) named separately, not conflated into a single "the system."
- [ ] When the user surprises you, the diagnosis identifies which failure mode (transfer / overgeneralization / underspecification / drift / invariant blindness) is operating before any intervention is chosen.
- [ ] When you choose a metaphor, you have explicitly listed at least one place it breaks down and how the interface will signal that breakdown.
- [ ] When the team disagrees, you have asked whether the disagreement is about the system or about the models of the system, and you have surfaced the divergent models before adjudicating.
- [ ] The model targeted for users is the smallest one that supports their role, not the most complete one that explains the implementation.
- [ ] Interfaces, error messages, naming, and defaults are aligned (not all five elements implying contradictory models).
- [ ] When you ship a model-shifting change, you have a mechanism to refresh user models (in-product notification, onboarding update, release note that explains the new model — not just the new behavior).
- [ ] If you are an agent working in an unfamiliar codebase, you have named the model you are currently operating from and tested at least one prediction against the system before producing substantial code.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Building a formal representation (entities, attributes, schemas) | `conceptual-modeling` | conceptual-modeling owns formal-domain representation; mental-models owns the cognitive layer above any formalism |
| Choosing between graphs, frames, rules as a knowledge representation paradigm | `knowledge-modeling` | knowledge-modeling owns paradigm selection; mental-models is upstream of paradigm choice |
| Empirically eliciting user mental models through research methods | `user-research` | user-research owns the elicitation methods; this skill owns the conceptual frame the methods serve |
| Transferring a known mental model to another person | `teaching-patterns` | teaching-patterns owns the transmission discipline; this skill owns the construction discipline |
| Reasoning about specific cognitive biases (anchoring, framing, recency) | (no direct skill — out of scope) | The cognitive-bias literature is its own discipline; this skill focuses on system-model representation rather than decision-making bias |
| Choosing the React hook for a state-management decision | `state-management` + library docs | Tactical implementation choice; this skill is the upstream framing |
| The drawing or notation of a model | diagramming tools / `knowledge-modeling` | The artifact is not the model; this skill applies to the cognitive structure, not its visual representation |
