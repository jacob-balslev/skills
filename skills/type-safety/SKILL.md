# Type Safety

## Coverage

The discipline of using a type system to rule out classes of runtime errors before they occur. Covers what soundness means and where TypeScript (and other gradual systems) is unsound, structural vs nominal typing, type narrowing and exhaustiveness checking, the runtime boundary problem, the difference between `any` and `unknown`, when to use type assertions (rarely) and when to validate (always at I/O boundaries), and the connection to runtime validation libraries.

## Philosophy

Types are claims about values; type-checking is proof-checking. A program that compiles is a program whose claims have been internally consistent — but a program is more than its compiler. Values that arrive from outside the program (HTTP responses, environment variables, parsed JSON, untrusted user input) have no type until you parse them, no matter what type annotation sits next to them.

The discipline of type-safety is to take the compile-time guarantees seriously and to know exactly where they stop. A codebase that pretends `JSON.parse(x) as User` is safe has confused a syntactic claim with a semantic guarantee. A codebase that validates at the boundary and trusts the type inside has correctly aligned the two layers.

In gradual systems like TypeScript, the discipline includes treating escape hatches (`any`, `as`, `// @ts-ignore`) as exceptional, justified, and rare — not as the default response to a type error.

## Soundness — What the System Actually Promises

| System | Soundness | Where it leaks |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | Unsound (by design) | `any`, `as`, function bivariance, ambient declarations, type assertions, `Object.keys()` typed as `string[]`, array `.find()` returning a `T` not `T \| undefined` (without strict flag), unchecked `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, mutable arrays in covariant positions |
| Flow | Unsound | Similar escape hatches; less broadly adopted |
| Python + mypy | Unsound (gradual) | `Any`, `cast`, dynamic-only constructs |
| Java | Sound for types, unsound for null | NullPointerException; generics erased at runtime |
| C# | Mostly sound | Reflection, `dynamic` |
| Go | Sound for types, structural interfaces | Empty interface (`interface{}`) is the escape hatch; type assertions panic on failure |
| Rust | Sound (memory + types) | `unsafe` blocks are documented escape hatches |
| Haskell | Sound (within purity) | `unsafePerformIO`, FFI |

**Practical TypeScript stance:** Enable strict mode (`strict: true`), enable `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, enable `noImplicitAny`. These flags close the most common leakage points. Without them, the system's guarantees are substantially weaker than developers assume.

## Narrowing

Narrowing is the type checker's mechanism for refining a broad type based on control-flow evidence. Use it instead of casts.

```typescript
function process(x: string | number | null) {
  if (x === null) return;            // narrows to string | number
  if (typeof x === 'string') {        // narrows to string
    return x.toUpperCase();
  }
  // here x is narrowed to number
  return x.toFixed(2);
}
```

| Narrowing technique | Use when |
|---|---|
| `typeof x === '...'` | Distinguishing primitives |
| `x instanceof Class` | Distinguishing class instances |
| `'field' in x` | Distinguishing discriminated objects |
| `x === literal` | Distinguishing literal types |
| Discriminated union via tag field | Designed-in narrowing for ADTs |
| User-defined type guards (`x is T`) | Custom predicates |
| `Array.isArray(x)` | Array vs non-array |

Discriminated unions are the strongest pattern:

```typescript
type Result =
  | { ok: true; value: User }
  | { ok: false; error: string };

function handle(r: Result) {
  if (r.ok) return r.value;  // narrows; `r.error` is not accessible here
  return r.error;            // narrowed to the error branch
}
```

## Exhaustiveness Checking

Force the compiler to verify that all cases of a union are handled. The pattern uses an unreachable `never` branch.

```typescript
type Method = 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE';

function describe(m: Method): string {
  switch (m) {
    case 'GET':    return 'safe';
    case 'POST':   return 'mutation';
    case 'PUT':    return 'idempotent replacement';
    case 'DELETE': return 'idempotent removal';
    default: {
      const _exhaustive: never = m;  // compile error if a case is missing
      throw new Error(`unhandled: ${_exhaustive}`);
    }
  }
}
```

When a new variant is added to `Method`, the `never` assignment fails to type-check — the compiler points at every missing branch. This converts a runtime "unhandled case" bug into a compile-time error.

## The Runtime Boundary

Type information stops at the runtime boundary. Values crossing in must be parsed; values crossing out are serialized.

| Boundary | Risk | Discipline |
|---|---|---|
| `JSON.parse(networkResponse)` | Returns `any` (or `unknown` with stricter typing); no validation | Parse with a schema (Zod, io-ts) before trusting the type |
| `process.env.X` | All env vars are `string \| undefined`, but TypeScript may type them as `string` via globals | Validate at startup with a typed env config object |
| `localStorage.getItem(k)` | Returns `string \| null`, but the contents are untyped | Parse + validate before use |
| `fetch(url).then(r => r.json())` | The promise resolves with `any` | Validate against an expected schema |
| Database driver results | Library-typed; trust depends on the library's contract | Verify the library actually checks types at the boundary |
| `Function(string)` / `eval` | Arbitrary code; arbitrary types | Avoid; if necessary, type the result as `unknown` |

The pattern: **validate at the boundary; trust the type inside.**

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

const UserSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  email: z.string().email(),
  createdAt: z.coerce.date(),
});

type User = z.infer<typeof UserSchema>;

async function fetchUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
  const raw = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`).then(r => r.json());
  return UserSchema.parse(raw);  // throws on validation failure
}
// Inside the rest of the program, User is trusted.
```

## `any` vs `unknown` vs `never`

| Type | Set of values | What you can do with it |
|---|---|---|
| `any` | All values | Anything (escape hatch — no checking) |
| `unknown` | All values | Nothing until you narrow (safe escape hatch) |
| `never` | No values | Nothing (used for exhaustiveness checks and unreachable code) |
| `void` | Returned, not consumed | Function return only; the value is "no value worth using" |

Rule: prefer `unknown` over `any` always. The cost is one narrowing step; the benefit is type-safety preserved.

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode is enabled (`"strict": true` in tsconfig).
- [ ] `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is enabled; array/object access produces `T | undefined`.
- [ ] No `any` appears in committed code without an inline comment explaining why `unknown` is insufficient.
- [ ] No `as Type` cast appears without an inline comment explaining why narrowing is insufficient.
- [ ] Every I/O boundary parses with a runtime validator (Zod, io-ts, valibot, etc.) before the value is treated as typed.
- [ ] Discriminated unions have an exhaustiveness check at every consumer site.
- [ ] Public API boundaries (exported functions, route handlers, library entry points) have explicit return types — not just inferred.
- [ ] `// @ts-ignore` and `// @ts-expect-error` are accompanied by a justification and a tracking comment.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Designing the JSON shape of an API endpoint | `api-design` | api-design owns the external surface contract; this skill owns internal type discipline |
| Verifying behavior at runtime with tests | `testing-strategy` | testing-strategy owns runtime verification; this skill owns compile-time |
| Designing database schema and column types | `data-modeling` | data-modeling owns persistence shape; this skill owns in-memory type contracts |
| Choosing between Zod / io-ts / valibot | individual library docs + `api-design` | Library choice is a tactical decision below this skill |
| Implementing the compiler / type-checker | language compiler implementation references | Out of scope — this skill is about *using* type systems, not building them |
