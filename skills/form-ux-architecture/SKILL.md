# Form UX Architecture

## Coverage

Design form structure and validation behavior. Covers field grouping, labels as structure handoff, required vs optional decisions, progressive disclosure, defaults, input formats, client-side validation, server-side validation, validation timing, submit lifecycle, error recovery, multi-step forms, review steps, autosave, and high-risk data entry.

## Philosophy

Forms are not data dumps. A form is a guided conversation that asks only for information the system truly needs, at the moment the user can answer it, with correction paths that preserve trust.

Client-side validation is a user-experience aid, not a security boundary. The server must validate every submitted field even when the client appears correct.

## Method

1. Name the user goal and the minimum data needed to complete it.
2. Remove fields that are not needed now or cannot be acted on.
3. Group fields by user mental model, not database table.
4. Decide required, optional, defaulted, derived, and deferred fields.
5. Choose validation timing: on submit, on blur, on change, or after async check.
6. Split client-side validation from server-side validation and map server errors back to fields.
7. Define submit, pending, success, failure, retry, and partial-save behavior.
8. Hand off labels and announcements to `a11y`, wording to `microcopy`, and endpoint shape to `api-design`.

## Evals

This skill ships a comprehension-eval artifact at [`examples/evals/form-ux-architecture.json`](https://github.com/jacob-balslev/skill-graph/blob/main/examples/evals/form-ux-architecture.json). The checklist below is the authoring gate for form UX architecture; the eval file is the grader surface.

## Verification

- [ ] Every field has a reason tied to the user's goal or system requirement
- [ ] Required fields are truly required at this step
- [ ] Field groups match how users think about the task
- [ ] Validation timing avoids hostile on-keystroke errors unless immediate feedback is necessary
- [ ] Client-side checks improve correction speed but do not replace server validation
- [ ] Server errors map back to fields or a clear form-level recovery path
- [ ] Submit, pending, success, failure, retry, and partial-save states are defined

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `a11y` | The task is labels, fieldsets, focus, keyboard flow, or screen-reader announcement. |
| `microcopy` | The task is validation-message wording, placeholder text, button labels, or error copy. |
| `api-design` | The task is endpoint shape, request/response schema, status codes, or error envelope. |
| `data-modeling` | The task is persistence schema, constraints, keys, or data lifecycle. |
| `interaction-feedback` | The task is feedback state staging after the form action starts. |
