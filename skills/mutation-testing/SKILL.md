# Mutation Testing

## Coverage

The behavioral test-suite quality measurement that introduces small syntactically-valid modifications (mutants) to production code and checks whether the test suite distinguishes the mutant from the original. Covers the mutant-operator vocabulary (arithmetic, relational, conditional, logical, constant, statement deletion, return value, method call removal), the kill-or-survive primitive, the mutation score metric, the equivalent-mutant problem and detection heuristics, selective mutation (Offutt et al.'s subset), execution strategies (full / incremental / bytecode / distributed), the modern tooling ecosystem (PIT, Stryker, mutmut, etc.), and the strategic distinction between mutation score as a target (anti-pattern) and the survived-mutant list as a to-do (correct use).

## Philosophy

Mutation testing inverts the coverage question. Coverage asks: did the test reach this line? Mutation asks: would the test catch a defect at this line? The second question is closer to what we actually care about, and the answer is more specific: each survived mutant is a directly addressable test-suite gap with a known location and a known kind of defect.

The discipline is not in maximizing the score; it is in reading the survived-mutant list. Each survivor is either a real gap (the test suite does not verify this behavior — write the test), an equivalent mutant (the syntactic change has no observable effect — exclude it), or an intentional non-test (defensive check, log string, debug path — note it as intentional). Working through the list with this classification produces a stronger test suite without engineering tests to satisfy the metric.

Mutation testing's modern feasibility is what makes it strategic. A decade ago the technique was largely impractical for large codebases. Today's tools — PIT's bytecode mutation, Stryker's incremental analysis, distributed execution, test prioritization — run mutation testing in CI in minutes for codebases of hundreds of thousands of lines. The cost barrier that historically pushed teams to coverage as a substitute is largely gone.

## Mutation Operator Catalog (Selective Set)

| Operator | Example | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| Conditional Boundary | `<` → `<=` | Off-by-one in comparisons |
| Negate Conditionals | `==` → `!=` | Inverted-condition bugs |
| Math | `+` → `-`, `*` → `/` | Arithmetic mistakes |
| Increments | `i++` → `i--` | Loop-direction bugs |
| Invert Negatives | `-x` → `x` | Sign errors |
| Return Values | `return x` → `return null` | Missing return assertions |
| Void Method Calls | `obj.set(x)` → `(no-op)` | Missing-side-effect bugs |
| Empty Returns | replace return with type's empty/default | Caught only if downstream uses the value |
| Constants | `42` → `43`, `true` → `false` | Magic-number assertions |

The Offutt et al. selective subset (about 5-8 operators) captures most of the signal of the full operator set at a fraction of the cost.

## Mutation vs Coverage — The Composition

| Aspect | Coverage | Mutation |
|---|---|---|
| What it measures | Did the tests execute this code? | Would the tests catch a defect here? |
| Signal direction | Floor (uncovered = unverified) | Direct measure of verification |
| Cost | Low — incremental with test execution | Higher — one test run per mutant |
| Goodhart susceptibility | High (easy to game) | Lower (harder to engineer to without writing real tests) |
| Precondition | None | Coverage at the location |
| Diagnostic output | Map of unreached lines | List of survived mutants |

A mature test-quality strategy uses coverage as the floor (reach everything important) and mutation as the verification signal (verify everything reached).

## Working With Survived Mutants

A survived mutant is not automatically a test bug. Classify each:

1. **Real test gap** — the mutant alters observable behavior and no test catches it. Action: write the missing test.
2. **Equivalent mutant** — the syntactic change has no observable effect. Action: mark as equivalent; some tools support inline suppression.
3. **Intentional non-test** — the code is intentionally unverified (defensive check, log message, debug path). Action: annotate; consider whether the policy should change.
4. **Off-scope code** — generated code, vendor code, scaffolding. Action: exclude from mutation analysis.

A test suite that addresses the real-test-gap survivors and accepts the rest will see its mutation score climb organically — and, more importantly, its real defect-detection rate.

## Incremental CI Integration

The pattern that makes mutation testing practical in continuous integration:

1. Compute the set of changed files in the PR.
2. Generate mutants only on changed lines (PIT: `--targetTests` + diff-aware mode; Stryker: incremental mode).
3. Run the affected tests against each mutant.
4. Report new survivors on changed code.
5. Block (or warn on) PRs that introduce new survivors above threshold.

This scales to large codebases because the work per PR is bounded by the PR's size, not the codebase's size.

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] Mutation testing is paired with coverage, not used as a replacement. Coverage measures reach; mutation measures verification.
- [ ] The mutation operator set in use is named and documented (full / selective Offutt subset / custom).
- [ ] Survived mutants are classified (real gap / equivalent / intentional non-test / off-scope), not treated as a uniform list of bugs.
- [ ] Mutation score is read as a list-of-actions summary, not as a target to engineer toward. Hard merge-gates on the score are avoided unless paired with explicit anti-Goodhart policies.
- [ ] Equivalent-mutant noise is acknowledged (5-15% typical) and either accepted in the raw score or excluded from a published adjusted score.
- [ ] For CI integration, incremental mutation on changed code is used; full mutation runs are scheduled (nightly, weekly) rather than blocking every PR.
- [ ] Mutation testing is not applied to dead code, generated code, or off-scope code that produces noise without value.
- [ ] The team can name the operator that caused each surviving mutant (off-by-one, condition negation, etc.) — the survival's *kind* is part of the diagnostic, not just the count.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Measuring how much of the code the test suite reaches | `test-coverage-strategy` | coverage measures structural reach; this skill measures behavioral verification |
| Designing test doubles (mocks, stubs, fakes) | `test-doubles-design` | test-doubles owns stand-in construction; this skill measures whether the resulting tests verify behavior |
| Choosing test levels (unit/integration/e2e) | `testing-strategy` | testing-strategy owns the strategic level question |
| Injecting failures into a deployed system | `chaos-engineering` | chaos is runtime fault injection; this skill is build-time source-code mutation |
| Generating input variations to find crashes | fuzz-testing skill | fuzzing varies inputs; this skill varies the program |
| Iterating on LLM behavior via evals | `eval-driven-development` | eval-driven-development is the LLM analog; mutation testing is for deterministic code |
