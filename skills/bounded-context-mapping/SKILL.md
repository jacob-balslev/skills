# Bounded Context Mapping

## Coverage

Map domain ownership boundaries and relationships between contexts. Covers bounded context naming, context maps, ubiquitous language separation, upstream/downstream relationships, shared kernel, conformist, customer/supplier, partnership, open host service, published language, anti-corruption layer, and boundary validation against real change scenarios.

## Philosophy

A bounded context is a language and ownership boundary, not a deployment unit. Splitting services without splitting language creates distributed coupling. Keeping one module while mixing incompatible meanings creates hidden domain bugs.

The central question is: "Where does this word mean something different?" Those differences drive boundaries more reliably than folder layout, teams, or database tables.

## Method

1. Extract candidate terms and workflows from requirements, code, docs, and incidents.
2. Mark terms whose meaning changes by actor or workflow.
3. Group concepts that change together under the same business capability.
4. Draw context boundaries around language consistency, not technical layers.
5. Label relationships: upstream/downstream, partnership, shared kernel, conformist, or anti-corruption.
6. Define translation points and ownership of canonical terms.
7. Stress-test with change scenarios: who changes, who breaks, who must approve?

## Verification

- [ ] Each context has a coherent language that does not overload key terms
- [ ] Cross-context communication uses explicit contracts or translation
- [ ] Shared kernels are intentionally small and high-stability
- [ ] Upstream/downstream power dynamics are named
- [ ] Anti-corruption layers protect local language from external models
- [ ] Boundary decisions were tested against real feature-change scenarios
- [ ] No boundary is based only on folder, team, or database layout

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `conceptual-modeling` | You need to discover entities and relationships before assigning ownership boundaries. |
| `data-modeling` | You need logical or physical data structures. |
| `api-design` | You need HTTP route, request, response, status, or versioning design. |
| `architecture-decision-records` | You need to record a decision that has already been made. |
