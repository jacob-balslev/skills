# Route Handler Design

## Coverage

The discipline of designing Next.js App Router `route.ts` handlers: the file-and-export convention (one async function per HTTP method, one URL per filesystem path), the Web-standard Request/Response interface that replaces the Node `req`/`res` pair, the body-parsing primitives (`request.json` / `formData` / `text` / `blob` / `arrayBuffer`), the default GET caching behavior and the segment-config opt-outs (`dynamic`, `revalidate`, `runtime`), dynamic segments and search-param access, manual CORS, the Edge vs Node runtime choice, streaming responses via `ReadableStream`, status-code and header discipline, error response shaping, the canonical webhook pattern (verify signature against the raw body before parsing), and the central design rule that determines when a Route Handler is the right surface at all: **the caller is not your own typed UI**.

## Philosophy

The App Router collapsed three things that used to be distinct in the Pages Router:

- **Pages**: rendered routes — moved to Server Components and `page.tsx`.
- **API routes**: HTTP endpoints under `/api/*` — moved to Route Handlers in `route.ts`.
- **Custom server handlers**: middleware, edge functions — partly absorbed by `middleware.ts`, partly by per-route runtime selection.

The Pages Router `/api/foo.ts` exported a default function taking Node's `req` and `res`. The Route Handler exports per-method async functions taking a Web `Request` and returning a Web `Response`. The change is not cosmetic — it makes Next.js endpoints portable to any runtime that speaks Web standards (Edge, Cloudflare Workers, Deno, browser Service Workers in principle) and removes a category of "Node-specific" footguns.

The deeper shift is that the App Router introduced a *competing* mutation surface in **Server Actions**. Before, every mutation needed an API route. Now, most mutations triggered from the app's own UI should use a Server Action (one declaration, no manual wire format). Route Handlers remain the right surface only when the caller is *not* the Next.js bundler's typed call site — mobile apps, third-party integrations, webhooks, server-to-server calls, server-sent events, binary downloads, and anything else that benefits from explicit HTTP semantics.

The Route Handler is the **public HTTP endpoint** surface. Use it when you need an HTTP endpoint. Use a Server Action when you need a mutation triggered from this app's UI. The two surfaces can coexist — many apps publish a Route Handler `/api/v1/posts` for external clients AND use Server Actions for the same mutations from their own forms.

## When to Use What

| Caller | Right surface | Why |
|---|---|---|
| This app's `<form>` or button | **Server Action** | One declaration; no wire format; progressive enhancement; revalidation built in |
| This app's component reading data on render | **Server Component** | No round-trip; co-located with the render that uses the data |
| Mobile app, third-party integration, server-to-server | **Route Handler** | Explicit HTTP contract; the caller does not run the Next.js bundler |
| Webhook from Stripe / Shopify / GitHub | **Route Handler** | Need raw-body access for signature verification; need exact status codes; vendor expects standard HTTP |
| Streaming SSE, binary downloads, large CSV/PDF | **Route Handler** | Returns a `ReadableStream` with the right headers; Server Actions can't model this |
| Client-side `fetch()` from a Client Component | **Route Handler** if it's a real API, **Server Action** if it's a mutation | Don't fetch your own internal mutation; that's what Server Actions exist to replace |

The single most common Route Handler mistake in App Router code is using a Route Handler for an internal mutation that a Server Action would serve better — duplicate type contracts, manual fetch wiring, no progressive enhancement, no built-in revalidation.

## The File-and-Export Contract

```ts
// app/api/posts/route.ts
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const posts = await db.post.findMany()
  return Response.json(posts)
}

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json()
  const created = await db.post.create({ data: body })
  return Response.json(created, { status: 201 })
}
```

The filesystem path `app/api/posts/route.ts` registers `/api/posts`. The exports `GET` and `POST` register the methods. Unhandled methods auto-return `405 Method Not Allowed`. There is no router-level config object, no separate registration step.

A Route Handler file cannot coexist with a `page.tsx` at the same path — `/api/posts/page.tsx` and `/api/posts/route.ts` collide and Next.js rejects the build. Choose one or the other per URL.

### Dynamic segments

```ts
// app/api/posts/[id]/route.ts
export async function GET(
  request: Request,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> },
) {
  const { id } = await params       // Promise in Next 15+
  const post = await db.post.findUnique({ where: { id } })
  return post ? Response.json(post) : new Response(null, { status: 404 })
}
```

In Next 15+, `params` is a Promise — `await` it. In earlier versions, it was a plain object. The shape of the typed second argument follows the dynamic-segment names in the path.

### Search params

```ts
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
  const limit = Number(searchParams.get('limit') ?? '20')
  // ...
}
```

`URLSearchParams` is the Web-standard read surface. There is no Next-specific helper for query strings beyond constructing a `URL` from `request.url`.

## Body Parsing

The `Request` object exposes five body-reading methods:

| Method | Returns | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `request.json()` | parsed JSON | Content-Type: application/json |
| `request.formData()` | FormData | Content-Type: multipart/form-data or application/x-www-form-urlencoded |
| `request.text()` | string | Plain text, raw payload, or when you need to verify a signature against the raw bytes |
| `request.blob()` | Blob | File upload, binary payload you'll re-serve |
| `request.arrayBuffer()` | ArrayBuffer | Low-level binary processing |

A body can only be read **once**. If you need both the raw body (for HMAC verification) and the parsed body (for handler logic), call `request.text()` and parse it yourself. The webhook section below demonstrates this.

## Default Caching and How to Opt Out

In production, a Route Handler whose `GET` export does not read from request-scoped sources (cookies, headers, search params accessed via `request.url`'s changing parts) is **statically cached** by default. Subsequent requests hit the cache.

For most APIs this is wrong. Opt out via segment config:

```ts
// app/api/posts/route.ts
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'      // always run; never cache

// or
export const revalidate = 60                // cache for 60s, then revalidate

// or
export const runtime = 'edge'               // run on Edge Runtime (changes capability surface)
```

`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` handlers are never cached — they're assumed to mutate. Only `GET` and `HEAD` are affected by the default-cache rule.

Reading cookies, headers, or `request.headers` automatically opts a GET out of static caching. So does reading `searchParams` from the request URL. The rule is: any handler that depends on per-request data is dynamic by definition; Next infers this from your code. The explicit `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` is the belt-and-suspenders option when the inference might be wrong or when you want the intent to be visible.

## NextRequest and NextResponse

Standard Web `Request` and `Response` work fine. Next provides extended versions for convenience:

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const session = request.cookies.get('session')?.value
  const country = request.geo?.country               // on Vercel Edge
  return NextResponse.json({ session, country }, { status: 200 })
}
```

`NextRequest` extends `Request` with `.cookies`, `.geo`, `.ip`, `.nextUrl`. `NextResponse` extends `Response` with `.cookies.set/.delete`, `NextResponse.redirect`, `NextResponse.rewrite`, `NextResponse.json` (a convenience that mirrors `Response.json`).

Use them when you need cookies or geo. Stick with standard `Request`/`Response` when you don't — it makes the handler more portable.

## Streaming Responses

A Route Handler can return a `ReadableStream` directly. Useful for SSE, AI streaming, large file generation, and chunked CSV/JSON exports.

```ts
export async function GET() {
  const encoder = new TextEncoder()
  const stream = new ReadableStream({
    async start(controller) {
      for await (const chunk of generateData()) {
        controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(chunk))
      }
      controller.close()
    },
  })
  return new Response(stream, {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
      'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-transform',
      'Connection': 'keep-alive',
    },
  })
}
```

The `Edge` runtime is the safe choice for long-lived streams — it has lower memory overhead per connection and avoids Node's connection-keepalive quirks. The Node runtime can also stream, but be aware of buffering behavior in your deployment platform (Vercel buffers Node responses by default unless you opt out).

## The Webhook Pattern

Webhooks need three things almost always: **raw body access, signature verification before parse, fast acknowledgment**.

```ts
// app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts
import { headers } from 'next/headers'
import { stripe } from '@/lib/stripe'

export const runtime = 'nodejs'         // some HMAC libs need Node crypto
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'  // never cache a webhook

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const signature = (await headers()).get('stripe-signature')
  if (!signature) return new Response('Missing signature', { status: 400 })

  const rawBody = await request.text()  // raw bytes for HMAC

  let event
  try {
    event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(rawBody, signature, process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!)
  } catch (err) {
    return new Response(`Webhook signature verification failed: ${err.message}`, { status: 400 })
  }

  // ACK fast; do heavy work async
  queueEventForProcessing(event)
  return new Response(null, { status: 200 })
}
```

Key decisions encoded above:

- **`request.text()`**, not `request.json()` — you need the raw bytes for HMAC; parsing first would mutate whitespace and break verification.
- **Verify before any business logic** — reject unauthenticated calls with a fast 400 before touching the database.
- **ACK fast** — return 200 within seconds; queue the actual processing. Vendors interpret slow ACKs as failures and retry, which produces duplicate processing if you're not careful.
- **`runtime = 'nodejs'`** — some vendor SDKs need Node-only crypto APIs (Stripe's `constructEvent` does in some versions). Edge runtime supports Web Crypto natively; check the vendor SDK.

The reliability concerns beyond the endpoint itself — idempotency keys, retry semantics, dead-letter queues, replay protection — belong to `webhook-integration`. This skill covers the framework-specific endpoint surface only.

## CORS

There is no built-in CORS helper in Route Handlers. Set headers manually, and handle the preflight `OPTIONS` request explicitly:

```ts
const CORS_HEADERS = {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://app.example.com',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, OPTIONS',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization',
  'Access-Control-Max-Age': '86400',
}

export async function OPTIONS() {
  return new Response(null, { status: 204, headers: CORS_HEADERS })
}

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const data = await request.json()
  return Response.json({ ok: true }, { headers: CORS_HEADERS })
}
```

Never reflexively allow `*` for credentialed requests — it doesn't work with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` and is a footgun for cookies and auth. Allowlist explicit origins.

If many routes need the same CORS policy, push it to `middleware-patterns` and the middleware can inject headers globally.

## Status Codes and Errors

Honor HTTP semantics (see `http-semantics` for the full discipline):

- **200** — success with body
- **201** — created (returning the new resource)
- **204** — success, no body
- **400** — client error: malformed input
- **401** — unauthenticated
- **403** — authenticated but not authorized
- **404** — resource not found
- **409** — conflict (e.g., duplicate)
- **422** — validation failure (unprocessable entity)
- **429** — rate limited
- **500** — unexpected server error
- **503** — temporarily unavailable

```ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    const parsed = Schema.safeParse(await request.json())
    if (!parsed.success) {
      return Response.json({ error: parsed.error.flatten() }, { status: 422 })
    }
    const created = await db.post.create({ data: parsed.data })
    return Response.json(created, { status: 201 })
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err)
    return Response.json({ error: 'Internal server error' }, { status: 500 })
  }
}
```

A thrown exception that escapes the handler becomes a 500. That's a usable fallback, but explicit `try/catch` plus a structured error envelope is better for any handler clients consume programmatically.

## Edge vs Node Runtime

```ts
export const runtime = 'edge'  // or 'nodejs' (default)
```

| Capability | Edge | Node |
|---|---|---|
| Web Crypto (`crypto.subtle`) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Node `crypto` module | ❌ | ✅ |
| Node `fs`, `child_process`, `net` | ❌ | ✅ |
| Most npm packages | ⚠️ depends on package | ✅ |
| Cold start | ~10–50ms | ~200–1000ms |
| Memory ceiling | lower (per Vercel: 128MB code, fast startup) | higher |
| Long-lived streams | ✅ better | ⚠️ platform-dependent |
| Vendor SDKs that need Node crypto | ❌ check vendor support | ✅ |

Default to Node when in doubt. Move to Edge only when (a) the cold-start gain matters (geographic distribution, low-traffic endpoints), (b) the handler is a streaming endpoint, or (c) the handler is on a hot path where the latency budget needs Edge's fast startup. Always re-test after switching — package compatibility breaks often.

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it's wrong | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Using a Route Handler for an internal mutation triggered from this app's UI | Duplicate type contracts, manual fetch wiring, no progressive enhancement, no built-in revalidation | Use a Server Action |
| Calling `request.json()` on a webhook before HMAC verification | The parse can mutate whitespace; signature verification fails | Read `request.text()`, verify against raw bytes, then `JSON.parse` |
| Forgetting `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` on a GET that depends on the request user | Cached response leaks one user's data to another | Either read cookies/headers (auto-opts out) or set `dynamic` explicitly |
| Slow webhook ACK because the handler awaits the heavy work inline | Vendor retries; duplicate processing | Queue the work; return 200 immediately |
| Throwing inside the handler and letting it become a generic 500 | Client gets no actionable error | Catch, log, return a structured error envelope with the right status code |
| Reflexive `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*'` with credentialed requests | Browser refuses to send credentials; auth breaks | Allowlist explicit origins; never combine `*` with credentials |
| Putting a `route.ts` and a `page.tsx` at the same path | Build error | Choose one — the URL has one purpose |
| Reading `request.body` as a stream and also trying `request.json()` | Body is consumed once | Pick one read method; if you need both raw and parsed, read text and parse yourself |
| Mixing App Router Route Handlers with Pages Router `pages/api/*` patterns (`req.body`, `res.status`) | Different API surfaces; types don't transfer | App Router uses Web Request/Response; rewrite to that shape |
| Long-lived stream on the Node runtime without checking platform buffering | Vercel/host may buffer the entire response before sending | Use Edge runtime for streams, or explicitly configure the host |

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:

- [ ] The handler's caller is genuinely external (mobile, third-party, webhook, cross-origin client) or needs explicit HTTP semantics — otherwise it should be a Server Action or Server Component.
- [ ] Each HTTP method that the endpoint should support is a named export; unsupported methods are not exported.
- [ ] Body is read exactly once (or read as `text()` and parsed manually when raw bytes are needed).
- [ ] GET handlers that depend on per-request data either read cookies/headers explicitly or set `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`.
- [ ] Webhook handlers verify signature against the raw body before any parsing or business logic.
- [ ] Webhook handlers ACK within the vendor's timeout budget; heavy work is queued.
- [ ] Status codes match the response semantics (201 for created, 422 for validation failure, 401 vs 403 distinguished).
- [ ] Errors are caught and returned with a structured envelope, not allowed to become bare 500s.
- [ ] CORS headers — if needed — are explicit allowlists, not `*` with credentials, and an `OPTIONS` handler is present.
- [ ] Runtime choice (`edge` vs `nodejs`) is intentional and the handler's dependencies are compatible with that runtime.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Designing an internal mutation triggered only from this app's UI | `server-actions-design` | Server Actions are the right surface for in-app mutations — one declaration, no wire format, progressive enhancement. |
| Designing the broader REST/RPC contract: resources, versioning, pagination, error envelopes | `api-design` | api-design owns the contract; this skill owns the Next.js implementation surface that hosts the contract. |
| Understanding what each HTTP method or status code means in the abstract | `http-semantics` | http-semantics owns the protocol semantics; this skill owns honoring them in App Router. |
| Adding auth, locale, or header injection across many routes | `middleware-patterns` | middleware runs once before route resolution and applies to many routes; Route Handlers run per-route per-method. |
| The full webhook reliability story: idempotency, retries, dead-letter queues, replay protection | `webhook-integration` | webhook-integration owns the cross-vendor reliability discipline; this skill covers the endpoint surface only. |
| The cross-cutting streaming model: Web Streams, SSE, RSC streaming, backpressure | `streaming-architecture` | streaming-architecture covers streaming as a concept; this skill covers the Route Handler streaming surface specifically. |
| The serialization/directive mechanics of `'use client'` and `'use server'` | `client-server-boundary` | Different boundary — client-server-boundary is for the bundler's component split, not for HTTP endpoints. |
