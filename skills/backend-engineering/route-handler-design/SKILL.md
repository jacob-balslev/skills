  mental_model: |
    A Next.js Route Handler is a file named `route.ts` (or `route.js`) under the `app/` directory that exports one async function per HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS). Each export receives a standard Web `Request` and returns a standard Web `Response` (or `NextResponse` which extends it). *The file shape IS the contract* — the filesystem path defines the URL; the export name defines the method; the function body defines the handler. No Node-style `req`/`res`; no middleware chain; no per-method routing config. Unhandled methods auto-return `405`. A `route.ts` and a `page.tsx` cannot share a path; one URL has one purpose. *Every Route Handler is a PUBLIC HTTP surface* — "only our frontend calls this" is not a security boundary; authenticate, authorize, and validate inside the handler. The five body-reading methods (`request.json()`, `request.formData()`, `request.text()`, `request.blob()`, `request.arrayBuffer()`) are mutually exclusive — *a body can be read only once*; if you need both raw and parsed (for webhook HMAC verification), read `text()` and parse yourself.

    *Default caching (Next 15+)*: Route Handlers are **NOT cached by default** — every method runs at request time. This inverted the Next 14 behavior where GET was statically cached unless you opted out. To cache a `GET`, opt IN with `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` (or, under Cache Components, wrap uncached data in a `use cache` helper). POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE are never cached. *Async request APIs (mandatory in Next 16)*: `params` is a `Promise` — `await` it (or type the context with `RouteContext<'/path/[id]'>`); `cookies()` and `headers()` are async — `await` them; synchronous access was removed in Next 16. *Runtime selection* (`export const runtime = 'edge' | 'nodejs'`): Node is the default and the recommended target — Vercel folded standalone Edge Functions onto Vercel Functions and now recommends Node, while `runtime = 'edge'` stays selectable at the framework level; Fluid Compute (bytecode caching + Scale-to-One warm instances) has largely closed Edge's cold-start advantage. *Webhook pattern*: read `request.text()` for raw bytes, verify HMAC against the raw body before any parsing, ACK fast (return 200), durably enqueue heavy work — vendors interpret slow ACKs as failures and retry.
  # purpose: the problem this concept solves and why the field exists. One paragraph.
  purpose: |
    Replaces the Pages Router's Node-style `/api/*` endpoints with Web-standard handlers that compose into the App Router's file-system convention. Solves the problem that Pages Router endpoints were tied to Node's `req`/`res` interface (not portable to Edge, Cloudflare Workers, or Deno) and required separate routing-layer registration. The deeper purpose emerges from the App Router introducing *Server Actions* as a competing mutation surface: Route Handlers become *purely the public HTTP endpoint surface*, used when the caller is *not your own typed UI* — mobile apps, third-party integrations, webhooks, server-to-server calls, cross-origin client-side fetches, binary downloads, server-sent events, anything that benefits from explicit HTTP semantics. The single most common Route Handler mistake in App Router code is using one for an internal mutation that a Server Action would serve better — duplicate type contracts, manual fetch wiring, no progressive enhancement, no built-in revalidation.

    Distinct from server-actions-design, which owns the *internal* mutation surface — a function the bundler turns into a network call from your own UI; this skill owns the *public-endpoint* surface for callers who aren't the Next.js bundler's typed call sites.

Distinct from middleware-patterns, which runs once before route resolution and applies to many routes via a `matcher` (the file is `middleware.ts`, renamed to `proxy.ts` in Next 16 and Node-only there) — Route Handlers run for one route and one method *after* that pass. Distinct from api-design, which owns the broader REST/contract/versioning discipline — this skill owns the Next.js implementation surface that hosts the contract. Distinct from http-semantics, which owns the abstract method/status/header semantics — this skill owns honoring them in App Router.

Distinct from client-server-boundary (which owns the bundler's component split, a different boundary).
  # analogy: one-sentence metaphor preserving the core mechanism.
  analogy: "A Route Handler is to a Next.js app what a service window at a government office is to its workflow — different windows handle different services (`GET /posts`, `POST /comments`); each window has a posted sign saying which forms it accepts and what stamps it returns; you do not walk into the back office (Server Action) unless you work there. The window is the contract: filesystem path = window number, export name = service offered, function body = the clerk's actual work."

    The wrong mental model is that Route Handlers are "Next.js's API routes" and that every HTTP endpoint in a Next.js app belongs there. They are, but with a critical refinement after App Router: *internal mutations from your own UI belong in Server Actions, not Route Handlers*. Using a Route Handler for an internal mutation duplicates the type contract (request shape + response shape + manual fetch wiring + manual revalidation), loses progressive enhancement (form submission without JS), and loses built-in revalidation.

# Route Handler Design

## Concept of the skill

A Next.js Route Handler is a file named `route.ts` (or `route.js`) under the `app/` directory that exports one async function per HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS). Each export receives a standard Web `Request` and returns a standard Web `Response` (or `NextResponse` which extends it). *The file shape IS the contract* — the filesystem path defines the URL; the export name defines the method; the function body defines the handler. No Node-style `req`/`res`; no middleware chain; no per-method routing config. Unhandled methods auto-return `405`. A `route.ts` and a `page.tsx` cannot share a path; one URL has one purpose. *Every Route Handler is a PUBLIC HTTP surface* — "only our frontend calls this" is not a security boundary; authenticate, authorize, and validate inside the handler. The five body-reading methods (`request.json()`, `request.formData()`, `request.text()`, `request.blob()`, `request.arrayBuffer()`) are mutually exclusive — *a body can be read only once*; if you need both raw and parsed (for webhook HMAC verification), read `text()` and parse yourself.

Replaces the Pages Router's Node-style `/api/*` endpoints with Web-standard handlers that compose into the App Router's file-system convention. Solves the problem that Pages Router endpoints were tied to Node's `req`/`res` interface (not portable to Edge, Cloudflare Workers, or Deno) and required separate routing-layer registration. The deeper purpose emerges from the App Router introducing *Server Actions* as a competing mutation surface: Route Handlers become *purely the public HTTP endpoint surface*, used when the caller is *not your own typed UI* — mobile apps, third-party integrations, webhooks, server-to-server calls, cross-origin client-side fetches, binary downloads, server-sent events, anything that benefits from explicit HTTP semantics. The single most common Route Handler mistake in App Router code is using one for an internal mutation that a Server Action would serve better — duplicate type contracts, manual fetch wiring, no progressive enhancement, no built-in revalidation.

Distinct from server-actions-design, which owns the *internal* mutation surface — a function the bundler turns into a network call from your own UI; this skill owns the *public-endpoint* surface for callers who aren't the Next.js bundler's typed call sites. Use Server Actions when the only caller is this app's UI; use Route Handlers when the caller is anything else or when you need fine-grained HTTP control. Distinct from a Server Component reading data on render — that should call the data source (DB/service) directly, never self-fetch its own Route Handler. Distinct from middleware-patterns, which runs once before route resolution and applies to many routes via a `matcher` (the file is `middleware.ts`, renamed to `proxy.ts` in Next 16 and Node-only there) — Route Handlers run for one route and one method *after* that pass. Distinct from api-design, which owns the broader REST/contract/versioning discipline — this skill owns the Next.js implementation surface that hosts the contract. Distinct from http-semantics, which owns the abstract method/status/header semantics — this skill owns honoring them in App Router. Distinct from webhook-integration, which owns the full webhook reliability story (HMAC details, idempotency keys, retry semantics, dead-letter queues) — this skill covers the endpoint surface only. Distinct from streaming-architecture, which owns the cross-cutting streaming model — this skill covers Route Handler streaming specifically. Distinct from client-server-boundary (which owns the bundler's component split, a different boundary). A Route Handler is to a Next.js app what a service window at a government office is to its workflow — different windows handle different services (`GET /posts`, `POST /comments`); each window has a posted sign saying which forms it accepts and what stamps it returns; you do not walk into the back office (Server Action) unless you work there. The window is the contract: filesystem path = window number, export name = service offered, function body = the clerk's actual work. The wrong mental model is that Route Handlers are "Next.js's API routes" and that every HTTP endpoint in a Next.js app belongs there. They are, but with a critical refinement after App Router: *internal mutations from your own UI belong in Server Actions, not Route Handlers*. Using a Route Handler for an internal mutation duplicates the type contract (request shape + response shape + manual fetch wiring + manual revalidation), loses progressive enhancement (form submission without JS), and loses built-in revalidation. Adjacent misconceptions: that `request.body` can be read multiple times (it cannot — pick one of `json`/`formData`/`text`/`blob`/`arrayBuffer`; if you need both raw and parsed, read `text()` and parse yourself); **that GET responses are statically cached by default** (they were in Next 14; since Next 15 Route Handlers are NOT cached by default — you opt IN with `export const dynamic = 'force-static'`, so the stale-data risk has flipped to an *accidental-uncached-cost* risk, not a *leaked-cached-response* risk — though `force-static` on a per-user GET still leaks one user's data to all); that `params`/`cookies()`/`headers()` can be read synchronously (they cannot since Next 16 — `await` them); that `request.geo`/`request.ip` exist on NextRequest (removed in Next 15 — they were middleware-only even before that; use `geolocation()`/`ipAddress()` from `@vercel/functions`); that a Server Component should fetch its own Route Handler to read data (it should not — that adds an HTTP round-trip and can fail during prerender/build; call the data function directly); that "only our frontend calls this endpoint" is a security boundary (it is not — any client can send the same request; authenticate/authorize/validate inside the handler); that calling `request.json()` on a webhook is fine (it is not — the parse can mutate whitespace and break HMAC verification; read raw bytes via `text()`, verify, then parse); that webhooks should do heavy work inline (they should not — vendors retry slow ACKs, producing duplicate processing; ACK fast with 200 and durably enqueue the work); that `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*'` works with credentialed requests (it does not — browsers refuse credentials with wildcard origin; allowlist explicit origins); that Edge runtime is always faster (it is not — Vercel folded standalone Edge Functions onto Vercel Functions and recommends Node, though `runtime = 'edge'` stays selectable; Fluid Compute + bytecode caching closed most of the cold-start gap, while Edge keeps a tight capability surface and many vendor SDKs require Node's `crypto`).

## Coverage

The discipline of designing Next.js App Router `route.ts` / `route.js` handlers: the file-and-export convention (one async function per HTTP method, one URL per filesystem path), the Web-standard Request/Response interface that replaces the Node `req`/`res` pair, the body-parsing primitives (`request.json` / `formData` / `text` / `blob` / `arrayBuffer`) and one-shot body consumption, the **off-by-default** GET caching behavior (Next 15+) and the opt-in mechanisms (`dynamic = 'force-static'`, the Cache Components `use cache` model), async request APIs (`params`, `cookies()`, `headers()` — `await` required since Next 16) and `RouteContext` typed params, dynamic segments and search-param access, the rule that every Route Handler is a **public** surface that must authenticate/authorize/validate inside the handler, manual CORS, the Edge-vs-Node runtime choice (Node now default and recommended) and deployment knobs (`maxDuration`, `preferredRegion`, static-export limits), streaming responses via `ReadableStream` with `pull()` backpressure, status-code and header discipline, error response shaping, the canonical webhook pattern (verify signature against the raw body before parsing, ACK fast, `after()` for short post-response work), a version-drift map across Next 13→16, and the central design rule that determines when a Route Handler is the right surface at all: **the caller is not your own typed UI or render tree**.

## Philosophy of the skill
The App Router collapsed three things that used to be distinct in the Pages Router:

- **Pages**: rendered routes — moved to Server Components and `page.tsx`.
- **API routes**: HTTP endpoints under `/api/*` — moved to Route Handlers in `route.ts`.
- **Custom server handlers**: middleware, edge functions — partly absorbed by `middleware.ts` (renamed `proxy.ts` in Next 16), partly by per-route runtime selection.

The Pages Router `/api/foo.ts` exported a default function taking Node's `req` and `res`. The Route Handler exports per-method async functions taking a Web `Request` and returning a Web `Response`. The change is not cosmetic — it makes Next.js endpoints portable to any runtime that speaks Web standards (Edge, Cloudflare Workers, Deno, browser Service Workers in principle) and removes a category of "Node-specific" footguns.

The deeper shift is that the App Router introduced a *competing* mutation surface in **Server Actions**. Before, every mutation needed an API route. Now, most mutations triggered from the app's own UI should use a Server Action (one declaration, no manual wire format). Route Handlers remain the right surface only when the caller is *not* the Next.js bundler's typed call site — mobile apps, third-party integrations, webhooks, server-to-server calls, server-sent events, binary downloads, and anything else that benefits from explicit HTTP semantics.

The Route Handler is the **public HTTP endpoint** surface. Use it when you need an HTTP endpoint. Use a Server Action when you need a mutation triggered from this app's UI. The two surfaces can coexist — many apps publish a Route Handler `/api/v1/posts` for external clients AND use Server Actions for the same mutations from their own forms. Next's own docs frame Route Handlers as the App Router's "Backend for Frontend" layer: an HTTP endpoint beside the UI, not a full backend replacement for every internal read or write. **Do not fetch your own Route Handler from a Server Component just to read application data** — call the database, service, or cached data helper directly. A self-fetch adds an avoidable HTTP round-trip and can fail during static generation or prerendering, because no request server is running for that internal URL at build time.

**Treat every Route Handler as public.** "Only our frontend calls this" is not a security boundary: a browser, mobile app, script, or server-to-server client can send the same HTTP request. Authentication, authorization, runtime input validation, rate limiting, tenant/user derivation from server-trusted state, and safe error shaping belong inside the handler or in code it calls. A `proxy.ts`/middleware auth redirect can be a useful UX gate, but the route itself must still reject an unauthorized direct request — middleware can be skipped, mis-matched, or bypassed.

## When to Use What

| Caller | Right surface | Why |
|---|---|---|
| This app's `<form>` or button | **Server Action** | One declaration; no wire format; progressive enhancement; revalidation built in |
| This app's component reading data on render | **Server Component / data helper** | No round-trip; co-located with the render that uses the data. Do NOT self-fetch your own Route Handler — call the data source directly |
| Mobile app, third-party integration, server-to-server | **Route Handler** | Explicit HTTP contract; the caller does not run the Next.js bundler |
| Webhook from Stripe / Shopify / GitHub | **Route Handler** | Need raw-body access for signature verification; need exact status codes; vendor expects standard HTTP |
| Streaming SSE, binary downloads, large CSV/PDF | **Route Handler** | Returns a `ReadableStream` with the right headers; Server Actions can't model this |
| Client-side `fetch()` from a Client Component | **Route Handler** if it's a real API, **Server Action** if it's a mutation | Don't fetch your own internal mutation; that's what Server Actions exist to replace |
| Static JSON / feed endpoint (Next 15+) | **Route Handler with explicit static/cache opt-in** | `GET` is dynamic by default in current Next; cache only when the response is safe to share across callers |
| Public API with many nested routes + shared validation | **Route Handler entrypoint, optionally with a small router (e.g. Hono) inside** | Next still owns the `route.ts` entrypoint and the surface-choice discipline; a router library only reduces boilerplate after the Route Handler choice is made |
| Project deployed with `output: 'export'` | **Only a static `GET` Route Handler** | Non-GET handlers and dynamic request-time behavior need a server/runtime |

The single most common Route Handler mistake in App Router code is using a Route Handler for an internal mutation that a Server Action would serve better — duplicate type contracts, manual fetch wiring, no progressive enhancement, no built-in revalidation.

## The File-and-Export Contract

```ts
// app/api/posts/route.ts
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const posts = await db.post.findMany()
  return Response.json(posts)
}

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json()
  const created = await db.post.create({ data: body })
  return Response.json(created, { status: 201 })
}
```

The filesystem path `app/api/posts/route.ts` registers `/api/posts`. The exports `GET` and `POST` register the methods. Unhandled methods auto-return `405 Method Not Allowed`. There is no router-level config object, no separate registration step.

A Route Handler file cannot coexist with a `page.tsx` at the same path — `/api/posts/page.tsx` and `/api/posts/route.ts` collide and Next.js rejects the build. Choose one or the other per URL.

The supported method exports are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS`. When you implement `GET`, Next can answer `HEAD` requests for clients that only need headers; implement an explicit `HEAD` export only when the header-only path needs different work or stricter control. Route Handlers can be placed at **any** route segment, not only under `/api` — keep `/api/*` for externally recognizable API surfaces, but route-adjacent handlers such as `app/rss.xml/route.ts` or `app/sitemap.xml/route.ts` are appropriate when the URL is itself the product surface.

### Dynamic segments

```ts
// app/api/posts/[id]/route.ts
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

// Idiomatic Next 15.5+: the generated RouteContext helper types params from the path.
export async function GET(request: NextRequest, ctx: RouteContext<'/api/posts/[id]'>) {
  const { id } = await ctx.params           // params is a Promise — await it
  const post = await db.post.findUnique({ where: { id } })
  return post ? Response.json(post) : new Response(null, { status: 404 })
}
```

`params` is a `Promise` and **must** be awaited — synchronous access was removed in Next 16 (it had a temporary sync-compat shim in Next 15). The `RouteContext<'/path/[id]'>` global helper (generated by `next dev` / `next build` / `next typegen`) is the current idiomatic typing; the older hand-written `{ params: Promise<{ id: string }> }` shape still works and is the right fallback if a project has not generated route types yet. Run `npx next typegen` to regenerate the helpers after changing dynamic segments.

### Search params

```ts
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
  const limit = Number(searchParams.get('limit') ?? '20')
  // ...
}
```

`URLSearchParams` is the Web-standard read surface. There is no Next-specific helper for query strings beyond constructing a `URL` from `request.url`. (Note: reading `request.url` is request-time data — under Cache Components it opts the handler out of prerendering, as `cookies()`/`headers()` do.)

## Body Parsing

The `Request` object exposes five body-reading methods:

| Method | Returns | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `request.json()` | parsed JSON | Content-Type: application/json |
| `request.formData()` | FormData | Content-Type: multipart/form-data or application/x-www-form-urlencoded |
| `request.text()` | string | Plain text, raw payload, or when you need to verify a signature against the raw bytes |
| `request.blob()` | Blob | File upload, binary payload you'll re-serve |
| `request.arrayBuffer()` | ArrayBuffer | Low-level binary processing |

A body can only be read **once**. If you need both the raw body (for HMAC verification) and the parsed body (for handler logic), call `request.text()` and parse it yourself. The webhook section below demonstrates this.

`request.bodyUsed` (a boolean) tells you whether the stream has already been consumed — useful for diagnosing a double-read (`bodyUsed === true` before your read means an earlier line already drained it). `request.clone()` *can* give you a second readable copy, but **clone before reading either branch**, and use it sparingly: the clone forces the runtime to buffer the body so both branches can be read, which creates unbounded memory pressure for large or streamed payloads. For the common raw-and-parsed case, prefer `text()`-then-`JSON.parse` over `clone()` — it buffers once, explicitly, and you control the bound.

## Caching: Off by Default; How to Opt In

> **This is the most-changed area of the Route Handler surface — verify which Next major you target.** In **Next 14**, a `GET` handler that didn't read request-scoped sources was *statically cached by default* and you opted out with `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`. **Since Next 15 the default flipped: Route Handlers are NOT cached by default.** Every method, including `GET`, runs at request time unless you explicitly opt in. Code and advice written for Next 14 (including "remember to add `force-dynamic`") is now backwards.

If a handler returns user-, tenant-, cookie-, header-, time-, or auth-dependent data, leave it dynamic (the default) and make that intentional with the code you read (`cookies`, `headers`, auth/session helpers, `request.url`) and the tests you write.

To **cache a GET** in the classic (non-Cache-Components) model, opt in with segment config:

```ts
// app/api/posts/route.ts
export const dynamic = 'force-static'       // cache: prerender this GET, serve the same response
// or
export const revalidate = 60                // cache, then revalidate at most every 60s
```

`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS` are never cached, even when placed alongside a cached `GET` in the same file. Only `GET` honors the opt-in.

**Footgun:** `force-static` on a `GET` whose response depends on the request user (auth, cookies, per-user data) serves one user's response to everyone. A cached API response is shared state; never cache a handler that depends on identity unless the cache key is deliberately partitioned by that identity. If the handler is per-user, leave it uncached (the default). Conversely, the old reflex of sprinkling `force-dynamic` everywhere is now redundant in most cases, because uncached is already the default.

### With Cache Components (Next 16 `cacheComponents: true`)

When [Cache Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/caching) is enabled (`cacheComponents: true` in `next.config`, the stable successor to `experimental.dynamicIO`/`experimental.useCache` and the route-level `experimental_ppr` flag), `GET` Route Handlers follow the same prerender model as UI routes:

- A handler that touches no uncached or runtime data is **prerendered at build time**.
- Reading runtime APIs (`cookies()`, `headers()`, `connection()`, `request.url`, `request.headers`, a DB query, the filesystem, or non-deterministic ops like `Math.random()`) **terminates prerendering** and the handler runs at request time.
- To include *uncached* data (e.g. a DB read) in a prerendered response, wrap it in a `use cache` helper with a `cacheLife` profile. Read request-time APIs (cookies, headers) *outside* the cached scope and pass only serializable values into the cached function when they are meant to be part of the cache key:

```ts
// app/api/products/route.ts
import { cacheLife, cacheTag } from 'next/cache'

export async function GET() {
  const products = await getProducts()
  return Response.json(products)
}

async function getProducts() {
  'use cache'           // CANNOT go directly in the handler body — must be a helper
  cacheLife('hours')
  cacheTag('products')
  return await db.query('SELECT * FROM products')
}
```

`use cache` cannot be placed directly inside the Route Handler body — extract it to a helper. Cached responses revalidate per `cacheLife` on the next request. In Next 16, `cacheLife` and `cacheTag` are stable (drop the old `unstable_` prefix). The old segment options `dynamic`, `revalidate`, and `fetchCache` are removed/disabled under Cache Components — the segment config knobs that remain in that model are `runtime`, `preferredRegion`, `maxDuration`, and `dynamicParams`. Check the project's Next config before suggesting a segment-config fix.

`revalidateTag` now requires a second `cacheLife` argument — the single-arg form is a TS error. In a Route Handler, call `revalidateTag(tag, 'max')` for stale-while-revalidate, or `revalidateTag(tag, { expire: 0 })` when an external webhook needs immediate expiration. `updateTag(tag)` is the Server-Actions-only "read-your-writes" variant for immediate refresh in the same request.

## NextRequest and NextResponse

Standard Web `Request` and `Response` work fine. Next provides extended versions for convenience:

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const session = request.cookies.get('session')?.value
  const cursor = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get('cursor')
  return NextResponse.json({ session: Boolean(session), cursor }, { status: 200 })
}
```

`NextRequest` extends `Request` with `.cookies`, `.nextUrl`. `NextResponse` extends `Response` with `.cookies.set/.delete`, `NextResponse.redirect`, `NextResponse.rewrite`, `NextResponse.json` (a convenience that mirrors `Response.json`).

> **Drift fix (Next 15):** `request.geo` and `request.ip` were **removed from `NextRequest`** in Next 15 — and even before that they were only populated in middleware, never in Route Handlers. For geolocation/IP on Vercel, import from `@vercel/functions`:
>
> ```ts
> import { geolocation, ipAddress } from '@vercel/functions'
>
> export function GET(request: Request) {
>   const { country, city } = geolocation(request)
>   const ip = ipAddress(request)
>   // ...
> }
> ```
>
> Off Vercel, read the platform's forwarded headers (`x-forwarded-for`, provider-specific geo headers) directly from `request.headers`. Treat geo/IP as non-security-critical hints — they are spoofable header data, not an authentication signal.

Use `NextRequest`/`NextResponse` when you need cookies. Stick with standard `Request`/`Response` when you don't — it makes the handler more portable.

## Streaming Responses

A Route Handler can return a `ReadableStream` directly. Useful for SSE, AI streaming, large file generation, and chunked CSV/JSON exports.

```ts
export async function GET() {
  const encoder = new TextEncoder()
  const stream = new ReadableStream({
    async start(controller) {
      for await (const chunk of generateData()) {
        controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(chunk))
      }
      controller.close()
    },
  })
  return new Response(stream, {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
      'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-transform',
      'Connection': 'keep-alive',
    },
  })
}
```

**Backpressure:** the `start(controller)` form above eagerly drains the whole source as fast as the loop runs, enqueueing every chunk regardless of whether the consumer is keeping up — fine for small, bounded, or already-buffered sources, but it buffers an entire slow-consumer backlog in memory for large or iterator-backed streams. For those, drive the stream from the `pull(controller)` method instead: the runtime calls `pull` only when the internal queue wants more (respecting the consumer's read rate and the `highWaterMark`/`CountQueuingStrategy`), so a slow client throttles production instead of forcing you to buffer it all. Reach for `pull` whenever the source is large, unbounded, or backed by an async iterator you don't want to run ahead of the reader.

```ts
function iteratorToStream(iterator: AsyncIterator<Uint8Array>) {
  return new ReadableStream<Uint8Array>({
    async pull(controller) {                 // called on demand, not eagerly
      const { value, done } = await iterator.next()
      if (done) return controller.close()
      controller.enqueue(value)
    },
  })
}
```

The Node runtime streams fine — on Vercel, Fluid Compute supports long-lived streaming responses without the per-connection memory pressure that once made Edge the safer choice. Historically the `Edge` runtime was recommended for long-lived streams (lower per-connection overhead); with standalone Edge Functions now folded onto Vercel Functions and Node recommended (see below), plus Fluid Compute available, **default to Node and verify your host's streaming/buffering behavior** (some platforms buffer Node responses unless you stream explicitly or set the right headers like `Content-Type`, `Cache-Control`, and `Connection`). Test the deployed platform for buffering, timeouts, and abort behavior — these vary by host.

For **AI-specific token streaming**, prefer the official AI SDK response helpers inside the Route Handler rather than hand-rolling the token/SSE protocol. For general streaming design choices (SSE vs WebSocket, backpressure semantics, partial-result correctness), route to `streaming-architecture`.

## The Webhook Pattern

Webhooks need three things almost always: **raw body access, signature verification before parse, fast acknowledgment**.

```ts
// app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts
import { headers } from 'next/headers'
import { stripe } from '@/lib/stripe'

export const runtime = 'nodejs'         // some HMAC libs need Node crypto
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'  // belt-and-suspenders: never cache a webhook (POST isn't cached anyway)

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const signature = (await headers()).get('stripe-signature')   // headers() is async (Next 16)
  if (!signature) return new Response('Missing signature', { status: 400 })

  const rawBody = await request.text()  // raw bytes for HMAC

  let event
  try {
    event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(rawBody, signature, process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!)
  } catch (err) {
    return new Response(`Webhook signature verification failed: ${err.message}`, { status: 400 })
  }

  // ACK fast — but DURABLY persist the event before returning 200.
  // `await` a real enqueue (a DB row insert, a queue `send`) — NOT a fire-and-forget call.
  // If the process dies after the 200 but before the work is persisted, the vendor's
  // retry is the only thing that saves you, and only if you returned non-2xx. So: persist,
  // then ACK.
  await enqueueEventForProcessing(event)   // durable: DB insert / queue send, awaited
  return new Response(null, { status: 200 })
}
```

Key decisions encoded above:

- **`request.text()`**, not `request.json()` — you need the raw bytes for HMAC; parsing first would mutate whitespace and break verification.
- **`await headers()`** — request-time APIs are async; synchronous access was removed in Next 16.
- **Verify before any business logic** — reject unauthenticated calls with a fast 400 before touching the database.
- **ACK fast, but persist first** — return 200 within seconds, *after* the event is durably handed off (an awaited DB insert or queue `send`). A bare unawaited `queueEventForProcessing(event)` is a footgun: the serverless instance can be frozen or killed the instant you return, dropping in-flight fire-and-forget work with no retry. The durable enqueue is what makes the fast ACK safe; the heavy processing then runs off that queue. Use `after` (next section) only for *droppable* post-response work, never for the critical enqueue. Vendors interpret slow ACKs as failures and retry, which produces duplicate delivery — so the downstream consumer must also be idempotent (that reliability layer is `webhook-integration`).
- **`runtime = 'nodejs'`** — some vendor SDKs need Node-only crypto APIs (Stripe's `constructEvent` does in some versions). Edge supports Web Crypto, but with Node now the default-and-recommended runtime there's rarely a reason to switch a webhook to Edge.

### Keep webhooks out of the proxy/middleware matcher

Exclude webhook paths from the cross-cutting `proxy.ts` / `middleware.ts` `matcher` unless there is a measured reason to include them. Current Next.js proxy can **clone and buffer the request body up to `proxyClientMaxBodySize`** (default 10MB); when a payload exceeds the ceiling the request continues with only a partial body available, and any upstream redirect/header/body manipulation makes raw-signature reasoning harder. The Route Handler should be the first application code that reads the body for exact HMAC verification — anything that buffers, clones, or transforms the body before it reaches the handler can break signature verification on large or exact-signature payloads.

### Post-response work: `after` vs a durable queue

Next ships [`after`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/after) (`import { after } from 'next/server'`; stable since Next 15.1, introduced as `unstable_after` in 15.0) to schedule a callback that runs *after the response is sent* without blocking it — usable in Route Handlers, Server Functions, Server Components, and proxy:

```ts
import { after } from 'next/server'

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const event = await verifyAndParse(request)
  after(() => logWebhookReceipt(event.id))   // runs post-response; does NOT block the 200
  return new Response(null, { status: 200 })
}
```

`after` is the right tool for **non-critical, fire-and-forget** post-response side effects — analytics, audit logging, cache warming. It replaces the old dangling-promise pattern (an untracked promise started after `return` can be cancelled or time-limited by the platform, and its failures disappear from the request path). But it is **not** a durable work queue: it extends the serverless invocation's lifetime via `waitUntil` and runs within the route's configured `maxDuration`, so if the function instance is killed or crashes before the callback finishes, that work is **lost** with no retry. For webhook processing that *must* happen exactly once — the order is fulfilled, the subscription is provisioned — still hand off to a real queue (the ACK-fast-then-queue pattern above), or persist a receipt before using `after()` to dispatch follow-up work by ID. The two compose: ACK with 200, durably enqueue the critical work, and use `after` for the cheap telemetry around it.

The reliability concerns beyond the endpoint itself — idempotency keys, retry semantics, dead-letter queues, replay protection — belong to `webhook-integration`. This skill covers the framework-specific endpoint surface only.

## CORS

There is no built-in CORS helper in Route Handlers. Set headers manually, and handle the preflight `OPTIONS` request explicitly:

```ts
const CORS_HEADERS = {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://app.example.com',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, OPTIONS',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization',
  'Access-Control-Max-Age': '86400',
}

export async function OPTIONS() {
  return new Response(null, { status: 204, headers: CORS_HEADERS })
}

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const data = await request.json()
  return Response.json({ ok: true }, { headers: CORS_HEADERS })
}
```

Never reflexively allow `*` for credentialed requests — it doesn't work with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` and is a footgun for cookies and auth. Allowlist explicit origins. If credentials are required, add `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` only alongside an explicit allowed origin, never with `*`. Expose any custom response headers browser clients need to read with `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`.

When the allowlist has more than one entry, you reflect the *request's* `Origin` back in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` per request (the header can carry only one origin, not a list). The moment the header varies by request origin, you **must** also send `Vary: Origin`:

```ts
const ALLOWED = new Set(['https://app.example.com', 'https://admin.example.com'])

function corsHeaders(origin: string | null) {
  const allow = origin && ALLOWED.has(origin) ? origin : ''
  return {
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': allow,
    'Vary': 'Origin',                       // so a shared cache keys per-origin
    'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, OPTIONS',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization',
  }
}
```

Without `Vary: Origin`, a shared/CDN cache can store the CORS response computed for one origin and replay it to a request from a different origin — either leaking access to an origin you meant to allow only conditionally, or wrongly denying a permitted one. `Vary: Origin` tells the cache to key on the request `Origin`.

If many routes need the same CORS policy, push it to `middleware-patterns` (or `next.config` headers). Note the Next 16 rename: `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts`, which runs on the Node runtime only and is meant primarily for request modification, rewrites, and redirects. It can set/forward response headers (so global CORS header injection remains viable) **and it can return a `Response`/`NextResponse` directly** — e.g. short-circuiting an unauthenticated request with `Response.json({ error }, { status: 401 })`, or answering a CORS preflight with `NextResponse.json({}, { headers })` (this has been supported since the advanced-middleware release in Next 13.1). What still belongs in a Route Handler is the *route's own* response — the resource body, streamed output, the per-method GET/POST/etc. handler — not an early-exit guard. Next positions proxy as a last resort; reach for it for cross-cutting interception, not as the place to author an endpoint's real payload.

## Status Codes and Errors

Honor HTTP semantics (see `http-semantics` for the full discipline):

- **200** — success with body
- **201** — created (returning the new resource)
- **202** — accepted: the work was handed off and will complete asynchronously (return an operation/status resource)
- **204** — success, no body
- **400** — client error: malformed input
- **401** — unauthenticated
- **403** — authenticated but not authorized
- **404** — resource not found
- **409** — conflict (e.g., duplicate)
- **422** — validation failure (unprocessable entity)
- **429** — rate limited
- **500** — unexpected server error
- **503** — temporarily unavailable

```ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    const parsed = Schema.safeParse(await request.json())
    if (!parsed.success) {
      return Response.json({ error: parsed.error.flatten() }, { status: 422 })
    }
    const created = await db.post.create({ data: parsed.data })
    return Response.json(created, { status: 201 })
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err)
    return Response.json({ error: 'Internal server error' }, { status: 500 })
  }
}
```

A thrown exception that escapes the handler becomes a 500. That's a usable fallback, but explicit `try/catch` plus a structured error envelope is better for any handler clients consume programmatically.

## Runtime and Deployment

```ts
export const runtime = 'nodejs'     // the default; 'edge' is still a documented, selectable runtime
export const maxDuration = 30       // seconds the function may run (also bounds `after()` work)
export const preferredRegion = 'iad1'
```

| Capability | Edge | Node |
|---|---|---|
| Web Crypto (`crypto.subtle`) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Node `crypto` module | ❌ | ✅ |
| Node `fs`, `child_process`, `net` | ❌ | ✅ |
| Most npm packages | ⚠️ depends on package | ✅ |
| Cold start | ~10–50ms (historical edge) | greatly reduced by Fluid Compute: bytecode caching + Scale-to-One warm instances |
| Memory ceiling | lower | higher |
| Long-lived streams | ✅ historically | ✅ on Fluid Compute |
| Vendor SDKs that need Node crypto | ❌ check vendor support | ✅ |

Pick the runtime by **dependency surface, data locality, resource/duration profile, and measured behavior** — not by a "faster" reflex:

- **Use Node when** the handler needs Node `crypto`/`fs`, database drivers, native modules, or vendor SDKs that assume Node; when work is close to a regional database; or when it needs higher memory / longer duration.
- **Use Edge when** the handler uses only Web APIs (`fetch`, Web Crypto, Web Streams), all imports are Edge-compatible, the work is lightweight and short, and geographic low latency near callers (without cross-region data penalties) genuinely wins.

> **Platform shift — read the scope precisely (verify the exact wording/date against the live Vercel changelog).** Vercel **folded the standalone *Edge Functions product* onto Vercel Functions** (the "Edge Middleware and Edge Functions are now powered by Vercel Functions" changelog) and now recommends the **Node.js runtime** for new work, citing full API support, Fluid Compute, and Active CPU pricing. This is **not** the same as the Next.js `export const runtime = 'edge'` option disappearing: the Edge runtime is still a documented, selectable runtime, and `runtime = 'edge'` still works at the framework level. The accurate summary is *Node is now the default and recommended target; Edge remains selectable* — not "Edge is gone." (The two models that proposed this enrichment cited conflicting effective dates; do not assert a specific cutoff date as fact — confirm it against the live changelog before quoting.) Fluid Compute (enabled by default for new Vercel projects since 2025) plus Node bytecode caching and Scale-to-One warm instances closed most of the cold-start gap that was Edge's headline advantage, which is *why* the recommendation flipped. Off Vercel, the Edge runtime maps to whatever Web-standard runtime your host provides — evaluate that host's own guidance.

**Default to Node** — it is now both the framework default and the recommended target. Reach for `runtime = 'edge'` only with a concrete, host-supported reason. Always re-test after switching — package compatibility breaks often, and the historical "Edge is faster" intuition no longer holds by default.

### Deployment constraints

Where a Route Handler can run depends on how the app is deployed — design with the target in mind:

- **Static export (`output: 'export'`)** ships only static assets, so **only a fully static `GET` works** — it must declare `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` and read no request-scoped data. Any handler that needs the request (other methods, dynamic GETs, webhooks) is unsupported under export and needs a server runtime instead. (`proxy.ts`/`middleware` is likewise unsupported in static export.)
- **Lambda-style / serverless deploys** run each invocation in an isolated, possibly cold instance. A handler **cannot rely on shared in-memory state** (a module-level counter or cache is per-instance and evaporates) **or on a persistent local filesystem** across requests. Use external state — a database, Redis, object storage, or the platform's runtime cache — for anything that must survive between requests or be shared across instances.
- **Long-lived connections don't fit this surface.** A Route Handler models one request → one response (it *can* stream a `ReadableStream`, but the request still completes). **WebSockets and other persistent bidirectional connections are not a Route Handler** — Vercel Functions do not support native WebSocket servers; run them on a dedicated WebSocket server or a realtime platform service.
- **Long work should not hold a Route Handler open.** Return `202 Accepted` plus an operation/status resource (see `api-design`) or enqueue a job/webhook pipeline, rather than blocking the response past `maxDuration`. `after()` covers *short* post-response work only, bounded by `maxDuration`; it is not a durable queue.

## Version Drift Map (Next 13 → 16)

This surface moves fast. When reading or reviewing existing code, identify the target Next major first:

| Concern | Next 13/14 | Next 15 | Next 16 |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET caching default | **cached** by default; opt out with `force-dynamic` | **NOT cached** by default; opt in with `force-static` | same as 15; plus Cache Components (`use cache`) model |
| `params` typing | plain object (sync) | `Promise` (sync-compat shim) | `Promise`, sync access **removed**; use `RouteContext<…>` |
| `cookies()` / `headers()` | sync | async (sync-compat shim) | async, sync access **removed** |
| `request.geo` / `request.ip` | middleware-only | **removed** → `@vercel/functions` | removed |
| Cross-route preprocessing file | `middleware.ts` (Edge) | `middleware.ts` (Edge) | renamed `proxy.ts`, **Node-only**; can return a `Response`/`NextResponse` (e.g. auth short-circuit), but authoring an endpoint's real payload still belongs in a Route Handler |
| PPR / dynamic IO | experimental flags | `experimental.ppr` / `dynamicIO` | `cacheComponents: true` (stable); old flags + `dynamic`/`revalidate`/`fetchCache` segment options removed in that model |
| Edge runtime (Vercel) | standalone | standalone Edge Functions folded onto Vercel Functions | Node recommended for new work; `runtime = 'edge'` still selectable |
| `revalidateTag` | `revalidateTag(tag)` | `revalidateTag(tag)` (single-arg deprecating) | `revalidateTag(tag, profile)` required (e.g. `'max'` or `{ expire: 0 }`); `updateTag` for read-your-writes |

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it's wrong | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Using a Route Handler for an internal mutation triggered from this app's UI | Duplicate type contracts, manual fetch wiring, no progressive enhancement, no built-in revalidation | Use a Server Action |
| A Server Component `fetch()`-ing your *own* Route Handler to read internal data | Pointless extra HTTP round-trip (and serialization) to call code already running on the same server; loses direct typing and request-scoped context; can fail during prerender/build (no request server for the internal URL) | Call the data-access function (DB query, service module, cached helper) directly in the Server Component. Route Handlers are for *external* callers, not for the app fetching itself |
| Relying on `proxy.ts`/middleware auth as the *only* protection for a Route Handler | Proxy/middleware can be skipped, mis-matched, or bypassed; direct HTTP callers still reach the route | Enforce authn/authz/validation inside the handler or the data layer; treat middleware as a UX gate, not the security boundary |
| Calling `request.json()` on a webhook before HMAC verification | The parse can mutate whitespace; signature verification fails | Read `request.text()`, verify against raw bytes, then `JSON.parse` |
| Letting `proxy.ts` / `middleware.ts` run on webhook endpoints by default | Body buffering/clone (`proxyClientMaxBodySize`) and upstream transforms can interfere with exact raw-body HMAC verification | Exclude webhook paths from the matcher; verify the raw body in the handler |
| Carrying Next 14's `force-dynamic` reflex into Next 15+ | Redundant — GET is already uncached by default; signals a stale mental model that may also wrongly assume caching elsewhere | Rely on the uncached default; add `force-static`/`revalidate` only to *opt in* to caching |
| `force-static` on a GET whose response depends on the request user | Caches and serves one user's data to everyone | Leave per-user GETs uncached (the default); cache only request-independent responses |
| Reading `params`, `cookies()`, or `headers()` synchronously | Removed in Next 16; throws / type-errors | `await` them; type the context with `RouteContext<'/path/[id]'>` |
| Reading `request.geo` / `request.ip` | Removed from `NextRequest` in Next 15 (middleware-only before that) | `geolocation()` / `ipAddress()` from `@vercel/functions`, or forwarded headers off Vercel |
| Putting `'use cache'` directly in the handler body | Not allowed; build error | Extract the cached work to a helper function with `'use cache'` + `cacheLife` |
| Slow webhook ACK because the handler awaits the heavy work inline | Vendor retries; duplicate processing | Durably enqueue the work, then return 200 |
| Fire-and-forget `queueEventForProcessing(event)` (unawaited) before returning 200, or starting an untracked promise after return | The serverless instance can freeze/die the instant you return; in-flight non-durable work is dropped with no retry, and failures vanish from the request path | `await` a durable enqueue (DB insert / queue `send`) *before* the 200; use `after` only for droppable post-response work |
| Reflecting the request `Origin` in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` without `Vary: Origin` | A shared/CDN cache replays one origin's CORS response to a different origin | Send `Vary: Origin` whenever the CORS headers depend on the request origin |
| Throwing inside the handler and letting it become a generic 500 | Client gets no actionable error | Catch, log, return a structured error envelope with the right status code |
| Reflexive `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*'` with credentialed requests | Browser refuses to send credentials; auth breaks | Allowlist explicit origins; never combine `*` with credentials |
| Putting a `route.ts` and a `page.tsx` at the same path | Build error | Choose one — the URL has one purpose |
| Reading `request.body` as a stream and also trying `request.json()` | Body is consumed once | Pick one read method; if you need both raw and parsed, read text and parse yourself |
| Mixing App Router Route Handlers with Pages Router `pages/api/*` patterns (`req.body`, `res.status`) | Different API surfaces; types don't transfer | App Router uses Web Request/Response; rewrite to that shape |
| Streaming large/iterator-backed output from an eager `start()` loop | Overproduces chunks before the client is ready; unbounded memory pressure | Drive the stream from `ReadableStream` `pull(controller)` so backpressure controls production |
| Hand-rolling an API subrouter with `if`/`switch` conditionals in one catch-all handler | Hard to read and test once the endpoint set grows | Split by Next filesystem routes, or mount a small router (e.g. Hono) deliberately behind the `route.ts` entrypoint |
| Reaching for `runtime = 'edge'` "because it's faster" | Vercel now recommends Node (standalone Edge Functions were folded onto Vercel Functions); Fluid Compute closed the cold-start gap; Edge's capability surface breaks many SDKs | Default to Node; switch to Edge only with a concrete, host-supported reason |

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:

- [ ] The handler's caller is genuinely external (mobile, third-party, webhook, cross-origin client) or needs explicit HTTP semantics — otherwise it should be a Server Action or Server Component.
- [ ] Every public Route Handler authenticates, authorizes, validates input at runtime, and derives tenant/user identity from server-trusted state — not from "only our frontend calls this."
- [ ] No Server Component self-fetches a Route Handler for internal reads — Server Components call the data function directly.
- [ ] Each HTTP method that the endpoint should support is a named export; unsupported methods are not exported.
- [ ] Body is read exactly once (or read as `text()` and parsed manually when raw bytes are needed); `request.clone()` is not used to double-read a large/streamed body (it forces unbounded buffering).
- [ ] The Next.js version and Cache Components setting were identified before applying caching guidance; GET is uncached by default (Next 15+); `force-static`/`revalidate`/`use cache` is added only when caching is actually wanted and the response is request-independent.
- [ ] `params`, `cookies()`, and `headers()` are awaited (mandatory Next 16); dynamic-segment context is typed (`RouteContext<…>` or an explicit `Promise<…>` shape).
- [ ] No `request.geo` / `request.ip` (removed Next 15) — geolocation/IP comes from `@vercel/functions` or forwarded headers, and is treated as non-security-critical.
- [ ] Webhook handlers verify signature against the raw body before any parsing or business logic, and ACK within the vendor's timeout budget by *durably* enqueuing the work (awaited DB insert / queue `send`) before the 200 — not via an unawaited fire-and-forget call.
- [ ] Webhook routes are excluded from `proxy.ts`/`middleware.ts` matchers unless body-size, raw-signature, and timeout implications were tested.
- [ ] Status codes match the response semantics (201 for created, 202 for accepted-async, 422 for validation failure, 401 vs 403 distinguished).
- [ ] Errors are caught and returned with a structured envelope, not allowed to become bare 500s.
- [ ] CORS headers — if needed — are explicit allowlists, not `*` with credentials, an `OPTIONS` handler is present, `Vary: Origin` is set when the response varies by request origin, and only needed headers are exposed.
- [ ] Runtime choice (`edge` vs `nodejs`) is intentional and host-supported, accounting for dependency surface, data locality, `maxDuration`, and streaming behavior; Node is the default and recommended target, but `runtime = 'edge'` is still selectable.
- [ ] Post-response side effects use `after` only for non-critical, droppable work bounded by `maxDuration`; exactly-once webhook processing is handed to a durable queue, not `after`. Long work returns `202 Accepted` rather than holding the handler open.
- [ ] Large or iterator-backed streaming responses use `ReadableStream` `pull()` or another backpressure-aware source.
- [ ] The handler's deployment target is accounted for: no reliance on shared in-memory state or a persistent local filesystem on serverless; only a `force-static` GET is used under `output: 'export'`; persistent/WebSocket connections are not modeled as a Route Handler.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Designing an internal mutation triggered only from this app's UI | `server-actions-design` | Server Actions are the right surface for in-app mutations — one declaration, no wire format, progressive enhancement. |
| Reading application data inside a Server Component during render | call the data source directly (DB/service/cached helper) | A Server Component self-fetching its own Route Handler adds an HTTP round-trip and can fail during prerender/build — there is no request server for the internal URL. |
| Designing the broader REST/RPC contract: resources, versioning, pagination, error envelopes | `api-design` | api-design owns the contract; this skill owns the Next.js implementation surface that hosts the contract. |
| Understanding what each HTTP method or status code means in the abstract | `http-semantics` | http-semantics owns the protocol semantics; this skill owns honoring them in App Router. |
| Adding auth, locale, or header injection across many routes (`middleware.ts` / `proxy.ts`) | `middleware-patterns` | middleware/proxy runs once before route resolution and applies to many routes; Route Handlers run per-route per-method. |
| The full webhook reliability story: idempotency, retries, dead-letter queues, replay protection | `webhook-integration` | webhook-integration owns the cross-vendor reliability discipline; this skill covers the endpoint surface only. |
| The cross-cutting streaming model: Web Streams, SSE, RSC streaming, backpressure | `streaming-architecture` | streaming-architecture covers streaming as a concept; this skill covers the Route Handler streaming surface specifically. |
| The serialization/directive mechanics of `'use client'` and `'use server'` | `client-server-boundary` | Different boundary — client-server-boundary is for the bundler's component split, not for HTTP endpoints. |
