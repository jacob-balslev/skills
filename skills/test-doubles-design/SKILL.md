The director's job is choosing the right kind of stunt-double for the scene: a dummy stands in the back of the shot (placeholder); a stub recites canned lines from off-camera (canned answers); a spy records which lines were spoken (call recording); a mock has a script that *fails the take* if the actor deviates (rigid interaction verification); a fake is a body-double trained to actually perform the action in a controlled way (working in-memory substitute). Casting mocks where a fake would do produces takes that pass when the stunt is performed exactly as written and fail catastrophically when the actor improvises a better line."

# Test-Doubles Design

## Coverage

The discipline of choosing and constructing the stand-in objects that replace real collaborators in tests. Covers the five-kind taxonomy (dummy, stub, spy, mock, fake) from Meszaros's *xUnit Test Patterns*, the state-vs-interaction verification distinction that determines which kinds fit which tests, the solitary-vs-sociable test-shape trade-off, the under-use of fakes as the robust middle ground, the cost ledger of every double (divergence, maintenance, false confidence, fragility), and the heuristics for when to use a real collaborator instead of any double. Includes the connection to London/Detroit-school TDD and to the api-design surface that doubles often pressure.

## Philosophy

A test double is a small lie the test tells the unit under test. The lie is useful — it makes the test fast, isolated, deterministic, and free of side effects — but every lie is also a place where the test's belief about the collaborator may diverge from the collaborator's actual behavior. The discipline of test-doubles design is choosing lies whose costs are worth the tests they enable, and recognizing that the choice of *what kind* of lie shapes what the test actually verifies.

The biggest design decision in test-doubles work is whether the test is verifying state ("after this action, the system looks like this") or interaction ("during this action, these calls were made to collaborators"). The choice is not a matter of preference; it determines the test suite's character, its fragility under refactoring, and its connection to the production design. London-school TDD favors interaction; Detroit-school favors state. Most working test suites mix both, and most working test suites have not chosen the mix consciously.

The under-acknowledged construct is the fake. Discourse about test doubles is dominated by mocks (because they are the most distinctive kind and the most natural fit for interaction verification), but fakes — working implementations with production-unsuitable shortcuts — often produce more robust tests with less long-term maintenance cost. A test suite that uses fakes for collaborators that admit a working stand-in (databases, clocks, HTTP clients) and reserves mocks for true behavioral verification is usually better-aged than the equivalent mock-heavy suite.

## The Five Kinds — A Practical Reference

| Kind | What it is | What it verifies | Fragility under refactor | Best use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dummy | Placeholder; never actually used | Nothing | None — it isn't exercised | Parameter slots the test path doesn't touch |
| Stub | Returns canned answers to calls | State after the action | Low — only the canned answer matters | Providing inputs the unit needs |
| Spy | Stub + records calls received | State and (post-hoc) which calls happened | Medium — call-shape changes break the spy assertion | Flexible interaction verification |
| Mock | Pre-programmed with expected calls; double itself fails on deviation | Interaction (built into the double) | High — call-shape changes break the test directly | Verifying a contract with a collaborator |
| Fake | Working implementation of the interface with production-unsuitable shortcuts | State end-to-end through the fake | Low — behavior is verified through a working substitute | Slow/nondeterministic collaborators with workable in-memory stand-ins |

## State vs Interaction — The Defining Choice

| Property | State verification | Interaction verification |
|---|---|---|
| Question the test answers | "After this, what does the system look like?" | "During this, what did the system do?" |
| Typical doubles | Stubs, fakes | Spies, mocks |
| Schools | Detroit-school (Beck), classicist | London-school (Freeman & Pryce), mockist |
| Refactor fragility | Low — internal call shapes can change | High — call shapes are pinned by the test |
| Design coupling | Loose — test sees the unit's surface | Tight — test sees the unit's collaborations |
| Failure mode | Coarse assertions; missed interaction bugs | Test mirrors implementation; refactor breaks tests that still produce correct behavior |

A practical heuristic: prefer state verification when the unit's behavior is naturally state-shaped (calculators, parsers, domain logic); prefer interaction verification when the unit's behavior is naturally collaboration-shaped (orchestrators, controllers, services that exist to coordinate other services).

## When To Use A Real Collaborator (Sociable Tests)

| Collaborator | Real-collaborator use? | If not, prefer |
|---|---|---|
| Pure functions, value objects, in-process domain logic | Yes — always | n/a |
| In-process services, repositories with in-memory implementations | Often yes | Fake if the real one has setup cost |
| Database access | Increasingly yes (containerized real DB in CI) | In-memory DB fake (SQLite/H2) over mock |
| File system | Usually fake (temp dir or in-memory FS) | Fake over mock |
| Time, clocks, schedulers | Always fake | Deterministic clock fake |
| Network (HTTP) | Recorded responses (fake) or real in integration scope | Fake (recorded responder) over mock |
| External paid APIs | Fake or contract test against recorded responses | Fake over mock |
| Other services across process boundary | Contract test against; double in unit scope | Fake or stub at unit scope; real in integration scope |

A test suite that mocks pure-function collaborators is over-mocking; a test suite that uses real third-party APIs in every unit test is under-using doubles.

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] Every double in the test suite is identifiable as one of the five kinds (dummy, stub, spy, mock, fake). Tests that say "mock" loosely (when the construct is really a stub or spy) are using the term in dialect, not in the precise sense.
- [ ] The verification style (state vs interaction) is consistent within a test. A test that mixes both styles is usually testing two things and should be split.
- [ ] Doubles sit at real seams (service boundaries, external dependencies, true injection points), not at artificial seams introduced just to enable the test.
- [ ] Where a collaborator admits a working in-memory implementation, a fake is preferred over a mock. Mocks are reserved for genuine interaction verification.
- [ ] No test mocks the database; database interaction uses an in-memory DB fake, a containerized real DB in CI, or a contract test layer.
- [ ] The school being practiced (London/Detroit/hybrid) is intentional, not accidental. The mock-to-fake ratio in the test suite is a measurement of which school is in use.
- [ ] Tests are not over-specified — strict mocks that pin exact call sequences are used only where the contract is genuinely about the call sequence (rare).
- [ ] Contract tests, integration tests, or production observability close the gap between mock-isolated unit tests and the real collaborator's actual behavior. Mocks alone are not the full verification story.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Choosing what to test, at which level | `testing-strategy` | testing-strategy owns the strategic question; this skill owns the doubles inside chosen tests |
| Designing the rhythm of test-first development | `test-driven-development` | TDD owns the discipline of writing tests first; this skill owns the doubles those tests use |
| Configuring a specific mocking library (Jest, Sinon, Mockito) | library documentation | library API choice is tactical detail below this skill's scope |
| Setting up a production feature flag or runtime alternative | `feature-gating` | feature-gating is about production behavior; this skill is about test-harness behavior |
| Designing the production interface a double would mimic | `api-design` | api-design owns the production contract; this skill consumes that contract for tests |
| Performing a behavior-preserving structural change | `refactor` | refactor owns the technique; this skill owns the doubles that may resist or enable the refactor |
