# Color System Design

## Coverage
A color system has three layers: a palette of raw color values (organized as scales — typically 9 to 12 steps from very light to very dark within a single hue), a set of semantic tokens that name colors by purpose rather than appearance (background-surface, text-primary, border-subtle, danger-emphasis), and a mapping that resolves semantic tokens to palette values per theme. The palette is the vocabulary; the semantic tokens are the contract that components consume; the mapping is what changes between themes.

Color spaces matter for scale construction. sRGB and HSL are non-perceptually-uniform — equal numeric steps in lightness produce unequal perceived lightness changes, with notable cliffs around yellow and teal. OKLCH and CIELAB are perceptually uniform color spaces where equal L (lightness) steps look equal regardless of hue, making them the appropriate space for generating scales. The CSS Color Module Level 4 specifies oklch() and lch() as first-class CSS color functions, and color-mix() in lch/oklch space produces predictable interpolation. The display-p3 gamut, supported by most modern displays, allows more saturated colors than sRGB in the green/red regions; declaring color-gamut: p3 or using p3 color functions delivers them while CSS color fallbacks handle sRGB-only displays.

Contrast is governed by WCAG 2.1, which specifies a contrast ratio computed from relative luminance: 4.5:1 for normal text (AA), 3:1 for large text (AA, defined as 18pt+ or 14pt+ bold), and 7:1 for normal text (AAA). APCA (Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm), the working draft for WCAG 3, uses a different model that better predicts perceived text legibility, with thresholds expressed as Lc values (60 Lc for body text, 75 Lc for small text). Tooling should compute both, but WCAG 2.1 remains the legally referenced standard in most jurisdictions as of 2026.

Semantic tokens decouple the system from a single visual treatment. text-primary on a light theme might be near-black at L=0.15; on a dark theme it might be near-white at L=0.96. Both resolve to the same component token and meet the same contrast requirement against their respective backgrounds. The discipline is to define semantic tokens by intent and contrast pair (text-on-surface, text-on-emphasis), never by appearance (text-dark-gray).

## Philosophy
Color choices are constraints applied to perception, not free decisions. Perceptual uniformity, contrast minima, color-blindness considerations (8% of men have some form of color vision deficiency), and gamut limits are real and observable. A palette that ignores them produces accessibility violations and uneven scales that designers have to compensate for with one-off tweaks.

Semantic tokens are worth the indirection because color meanings outlive specific values. "Danger" stays danger when the brand red shifts a few degrees; components keep working. Tying components directly to palette values turns every brand refresh into a code change.

## Verification
- Every text/background pair used in the product meets WCAG 2.1 AA at minimum; an automated check runs in CI against the token combinations.
- Scales are generated in OKLCH or LCH and exported to sRGB or display-p3; equal step indices have equal lightness within ±2 L units.
- Semantic tokens are named by intent (background-surface, danger-emphasis) not by appearance (gray-50, red-700) in component code.
- Light and dark themes provide every semantic token; no token is light-only or dark-only.
- Color is not the only signal for state — error states pair red with an icon and text, not red alone, to remain accessible to color-blind users.
- The palette has been previewed under simulated protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia, and important distinctions remain visible.
- Brand color is anchored at a specific scale step (e.g., brand at step 600) so the surrounding scale is generated rather than hand-tuned.

## Do NOT Use When
- The task is picking a single brand color with no system implications. That is a brand decision, not a system decision.
- You are implementing the runtime mechanics of theme switching, persistence, and asset variants. Use theme-system-design and dark-mode-implementation.
- The work is non-color tokens — spacing, typography, motion. Use typography-system or visual-design-foundations.
- The concern is purely accessibility-criterion lookup rather than palette construction. Use a11y.
- You need to choose color values for a single illustration or marketing graphic with no token impact. Treat as art direction, not system design.
