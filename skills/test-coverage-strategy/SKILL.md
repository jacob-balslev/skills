# Test-Coverage Strategy

## Coverage

The strategic use of code-coverage measurement as a diagnostic signal about test-suite gaps, without falling into the Goodhart-Law trap of treating the coverage number as the target. Covers the coverage-criterion hierarchy (function → line → branch → decision → condition → MC/DC → path), Marick's distinction between coverage as floor (uncovered code is definitely untested) and coverage as ceiling (covered code is necessarily tested — false), the covered-vs-tested distinction, the safety-critical industry's MC/DC standard (DO-178C aviation, ISO 26262 automotive) as empirical evidence for granularity-matching, and the strategic uses of coverage (diagnostic, floor-gating, diff-based gating, audit artifact).

## Philosophy

Coverage measures execution, not verification. A test that calls every function but asserts nothing has 100% line coverage and zero testing value; a test with rich assertions but missing some branches has lower coverage and may have much higher testing value. The metric's strategic value is in the *floor direction*: uncovered code is definitely untested. The reverse direction — covered code is necessarily tested — is not reliable.

The discipline of coverage strategy is using the metric where it is informative (gap detection, regression signaling, test-effort allocation, audit compliance) and refusing to use it where it is misleading (as a quality target, as a substitute for behavioral verification, as a ceiling claim about test thoroughness). The risk is large because coverage numbers are easy to produce, easy to gate on, and easy to optimize for in ways that degrade the test suite.

Most working test suites should aim for coverage that is *high enough to reveal gaps without becoming the goal*. Where the certification environment mandates a specific criterion (MC/DC for safety-critical), the discipline shifts: the criterion is given; the work is meeting it without coverage-padding.

## The Criterion Hierarchy

| Criterion | What it requires | Test count for `A && B && C` | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Function | Each function called once | 1 | Detects entirely-untested functions |
| Statement / Line | Each line executed once | 1 | Default in most tools |
| Branch | Each branch (true/false) taken once | 2 | Catches missed-else-branch bugs |
| Decision | Each decision evaluated both ways | 2 | Often conflated with branch in tooling |
| Condition | Each Boolean sub-expression both true and false | 2 | Catches short-circuit-evaluation bugs |
| MC/DC | Each condition independently affects the decision | 4 (N+1 for N conditions) | DO-178C Level A; ISO 26262 ASIL-D |
| Multiple condition | All combinations of conditions exercised | 8 (2^N) | Combinatorial; rarely required |
| Path | Every execution path through the function | Infeasible for loops | Theoretical |

The right criterion depends on where the code's failure modes hide. Straight-line procedural code: line coverage. Complex Boolean conditions (access control, rate limiters, financial logic): branch or condition coverage. Safety-critical: MC/DC by mandate.

## Covered vs Tested

| Aspect | Covered | Tested |
|---|---|---|
| What it measures | Test reached the code | Test verified the code's behavior |
| Detected by | Coverage tool | Assertion presence + correctness |
| 100% achievable cheaply by | Function/line traversal with no assertions | Real behavioral assertions |
| Signal direction | Floor (uncovered = untested) reliable | Ceiling (covered = tested) unreliable |
| Strategic value | Gap detection | Quality assurance |

A test that calls `processOrder()` but asserts nothing covers `processOrder` and tests nothing in it. The coverage report cannot distinguish this from a test with full behavioral assertions. The discipline is to read coverage as one part of a picture that includes assertion review, mutation testing (see `mutation-testing`), and integration test coverage.

## When To Use Each Criterion

| Code character | Recommended criterion | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Straight-line procedural; few branches | Line | Adequate; cheap |
| Branchy business logic | Branch | Catches missed-else cases line misses |
| Compound Boolean conditions (access checks, rate limiting, financial gates) | Condition or MC/DC | Catches short-circuit-evaluation bugs |
| Safety-critical (aviation, automotive, medical) | MC/DC | Mandated by DO-178C, ISO 26262 |
| Algorithmic / mathematical | Branch + mutation testing | Coverage + behavioral signal |
| Pure utility / value objects | Line | Most failure modes line coverage catches |
| Error / exception paths | Branch (or accept the gap) | Branch reveals untested error handling |

## Goodhart-Resistant Strategy

Patterns that use coverage strategically without producing Goodhart-pressure:

1. **Diagnostic, not gating.** Report coverage on PRs; don't fail builds on coverage. Reviewers read the report; the team adjusts allocation.
2. **Diff-based gating at low threshold.** New/changed lines must be covered above (e.g.) 70%, not the codebase as a whole. Lower aggregate target, higher meaningfulness of each test.
3. **Coverage as part of a panel.** Pair coverage with mutation score, assertion density, and integration test breadth. No single metric is the target.
4. **Per-module differentiation.** Higher coverage required for high-impact modules (financial calculation, security, data-loss-risk); lower for stable utility code.
5. **Annual review of gaps.** Walk the uncovered code; decide consciously whether the gap is acceptable (defensive code, logging) or a real test debt.

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] The team's coverage criterion is appropriate to the code's failure modes (line for procedural, branch for branchy, MC/DC for safety-critical). The default criterion is not assumed correct without checking what it measures.
- [ ] Coverage is read as a floor signal (gaps point to untested code), not a ceiling signal (high coverage proves tests are good). The team distinguishes "covered" from "tested" in conversation and in policy.
- [ ] Coverage gates, if used, are set at a level achievable by real behavioral testing — not a level that forces coverage-padding tests.
- [ ] Coverage of dead code is excluded or noted. A dropping coverage percentage is interpreted (could be dead-code removal, test deletion, or new untested code), not treated as automatically bad.
- [ ] Coverage is paired with at least one behavioral measurement (mutation testing, assertion review, integration-test breadth) in any quality conversation about the test suite.
- [ ] For safety-critical code, the certification standard's coverage criterion is the criterion in use, and the tool's reported number actually matches the standard's definition.
- [ ] Production observability is treated as a separate verification dimension from coverage. Coverage tells you what tests exercised; observability tells you what production exercises.
- [ ] The team can explain a coverage gap on any specific module as either "we don't need to test this because [reason]" or "we should test this and have not." Unexplained gaps are test debt.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Deciding which test levels (unit/integration/e2e) to invest in | `testing-strategy` | testing-strategy owns the level/scope question; this skill owns the measurement of structural reach |
| Measuring whether tests would catch deliberately-introduced defects | `mutation-testing` | mutation owns the behavioral signal; this skill owns the structural signal |
| Constructing test doubles (mocks, stubs, fakes) | `test-doubles-design` | test-doubles-design owns the stand-in design |
| Iterating on LLM behavior via an eval suite | `eval-driven-development` | eval-driven-development is the LLM-system analog; this skill is about deterministic-software coverage |
| Configuring Istanbul, Jest coverage, JaCoCo, Coverlet | tool documentation | tool API choice is tactical detail below this skill's scope |
