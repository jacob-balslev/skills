# System Interface Contracts

## Coverage

Design and audit contracts across boundaries: modules, services, event producers/consumers, background jobs, APIs, webhooks, databases, and agents. Covers ownership, data shape, required/optional fields, invariants, preconditions, postconditions, idempotency, ordering, error behavior, retries, compatibility, versioning, and verification.

## Philosophy

A boundary without a contract is a rumor. The implementation may work today because both sides accidentally agree, but the first independent change exposes the missing contract.

Contracts should be specific enough to protect both sides from drift and small enough that teams can keep them true. The contract is not the implementation. It is the stable promise at the boundary.

## Method

1. Name the producer, consumer, owner, and direction of dependency.
2. Define inputs, outputs, and allowed states.
3. State invariants and forbidden states.
4. Define error, retry, timeout, and idempotency behavior.
5. Specify compatibility: additive changes, breaking changes, versioning, and deprecation.
6. Identify observability required to prove the contract is being honored.
7. Add contract tests or fixtures where possible.

## Evals

This skill ships a comprehension-eval artifact at [`examples/evals/system-interface-contracts.json`](https://github.com/jacob-balslev/skill-graph/blob/main/examples/evals/system-interface-contracts.json). The checklist below is the authoring gate for system-boundary contracts; the eval file is the grader surface.

## Verification

- [ ] Each side has a named owner
- [ ] Required and optional fields are explicit
- [ ] Invariants and forbidden states are stated
- [ ] Error and retry behavior is deterministic
- [ ] Idempotency keys or deduplication rules exist where duplicate delivery is possible
- [ ] Compatibility rules distinguish additive from breaking changes
- [ ] Contract tests, fixtures, or examples exist for positive and negative cases

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `api-design` | You specifically need REST/resource endpoint shape, HTTP semantics, or API envelope design. |
| `event-contract-design` | You specifically need asynchronous event envelope, schema, topic, replay, or consumer compatibility rules. |
| `data-modeling` | You need persistence schema, keys, indexes, or data lifecycle. |
| `debugging` | A boundary has already failed and the task is root-cause analysis. |
| `architecture-decision-records` | The contract is chosen and needs a durable decision record. |
