# Layout Composition

## Coverage

Compose page and screen structure so the hierarchy survives real viewports. Covers section order, scan pattern, grid and flex choices, responsive breakpoints, mobile-first stacking, stable dimensions, responsive media, density, empty/loaded-state footprint, and handoff from task hierarchy to implementation-ready layout.

## Philosophy

Layout is the visible contract between task priority and available space. A surface that has the right content can still fail if primary information collapses below the fold, controls jump between states, or a desktop-only composition is squeezed into a narrow viewport.

Start from hierarchy, then choose structure. Do not design to named devices; design to the point where the content starts to break.

## Method

1. Read the primary, secondary, and supporting hierarchy from `task-analysis` or the route contract.
2. Identify fixed-format elements: tables, cards, charts, boards, media, toolbars, and forms.
3. Choose the scan pattern: single column, master-detail, sidebar/content, table-first, card grid, or step flow.
4. Define responsive breakpoints where content breaks, not where devices are marketed.
5. Set stable dimensions for elements that must not resize on hover, loading, or label changes.
6. Decide what collapses, stacks, pins, hides, or moves at each breakpoint.
7. Check mobile, tablet, desktop, low-data, loading, empty, and error states.

## Evals

This skill ships a comprehension-eval artifact at [`examples/evals/layout-composition.json`](https://github.com/jacob-balslev/skill-graph/blob/main/examples/evals/layout-composition.json). The checklist below is the authoring gate for layout decisions; the eval file is the grader surface.

## Verification

- [ ] The primary task remains visible before supporting detail
- [ ] Breakpoints are content-driven rather than device-name-driven
- [ ] Fixed-format elements have stable dimensions or aspect ratios
- [ ] Mobile and narrow layouts preserve action order and recovery paths
- [ ] Loading, empty, and error states do not shift the core layout unpredictably
- [ ] Responsive media cannot overflow its container
- [ ] Accessibility landmarks, heading order, and focus order still match the visual order

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `task-analysis` | The user goal, top task, or first-viewport hierarchy is not yet known. |
| `information-architecture` | The problem is global navigation, sitemap shape, or page grouping. |
| `visual-design-foundations` | The task is color, typography, spacing taste, mood, or polish. |
| `design-system-architecture` | The task is token taxonomy, component API, theming, or system governance. |
| `a11y` | The primary question is WCAG, ARIA, keyboard behavior, labels, or assistive-tech output. |
