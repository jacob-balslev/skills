# E2e Test Design

## Coverage

The discipline of designing tests that exercise a complete user-visible path through the entire system — UI, application, data, third parties, and back — with the user journey as the unit of test. Covers the five primitives (journey, environment, test data, observable assertion, wait strategy), the pyramid/trophy position (top tier, fewest tests, highest cost, highest user-meaningful coverage), the test-data strategies that determine isolation and flake rate, the wait-for-condition synchronization discipline that prevents flake, the framework landscape (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, Puppeteer), and the cost-and-count trade-off that distinguishes good e2e suites from over-investment.

## Philosophy

E2e tests are the smallest tier of the test suite by count and the largest by individual cost. They are the evidence that the *assembled system* works for *real users*; nothing else in the test suite provides that evidence. They are also the most expensive tests to write, run, and maintain.

The discipline is making each e2e test *load-bearing*: covers a journey that matters; asserts outcomes that prove the system works for users; runs reliably with near-zero flake. A team with one hundred low-value flaky e2e tests is worse off than a team with ten high-value reliable e2e tests, because trust in the suite — the willingness to take a red build as evidence of a real bug — is the suite's value.

The right e2e count is much lower than most teams intuit. The pyramid/trophy framings put e2e at the top — fewest tests, by design. Teams that grow e2e suites to hundreds of tests usually have many tests that should be integration tests; the discipline is reversing that drift.

## What An E2e Test Looks Like

| Component | Detail |
|---|---|
| Scope | A complete user journey (signup, checkout, primary creative action) |
| Environment | Production-like; all real components, recorded fakes for paid third parties |
| Stack | Full UI, application, database, message bus, file storage |
| Test data | Isolated per test, typically via per-test user accounts with unique IDs |
| Assertions | DOM elements visible, URL changes, key user-observable outcomes |
| Wait strategy | Wait-for-condition with generous timeouts; never hardcoded delays |
| Diagnostics | Screenshot on failure, video capture, trace viewer for replay |
| Runtime | Seconds to tens of seconds per test |
| Suite size | 10-50 critical-path; 50-200 for broader regression |
| Suite runtime | Under 30 minutes total via parallelization |

## The Wait-Strategy Discipline

E2e flake's primary cause is bad synchronization. The discipline:

| Anti-pattern | Pattern |
|---|---|
| `page.click('button'); sleep(2); expect(elem).toBeVisible()` | `page.click('button'); await expect(elem).toBeVisible()` (auto-waits up to timeout) |
| `sleep(5); expect(toast).toBe('Saved')` | `await expect(toast).toBe('Saved', { timeout: 10_000 })` (retries until match) |
| `page.click('a'); sleep(3); page.click('next')` | `page.click('a'); await page.waitForURL(/expected/); page.click('next')` |
| Hardcoded delay for network call | `await page.waitForResponse(predicate)` |
| Hardcoded delay for animation | Animation-aware wait or disable animations in test config |

Playwright, Cypress, and Selenium all support wait-for-condition. The discipline is using it everywhere instead of `sleep`.

## Test-Data Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Speed | Isolation | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fresh environment per test | Slowest | Strongest | Highest-stakes journeys; very few tests |
| Per-test data with unique IDs | Fast | Strong | Most production e2e suites |
| Fixture seed + per-user partition | Fast | Strong (if partition discipline holds) | Suites with shared lookup data |
| Shared snapshot, read-only discipline | Fastest | Relies on discipline | Pure read flows; rare |

Per-test data with unique IDs is the working standard. Each test creates the users, orders, or whatever entities it needs, with IDs that don't collide with other tests. Cleanup happens at test end or suite end.

## Framework Selection

| Framework | Strengths | Weaknesses | Best fit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Playwright | Modern, fast, multi-browser, auto-waiting, trace viewer | Newer ecosystem, smaller community than Selenium | New projects; recommended default |
| Cypress | Excellent DX, retry-until-pass, in-browser test execution | Chromium-family focused, iframe and tab handling awkward | Developer-experience-focused teams |
| Selenium WebDriver | Largest ecosystem, cross-language, every browser | Slower, more boilerplate, more flake-prone without careful setup | Large enterprise / legacy / cross-browser-matrix |
| Puppeteer | Lower-level Chrome API | Chromium-only, less abstraction | Lower-level scripting and scraping |
| Detox / Appium / Maestro | Mobile-native | Mobile-only | Mobile app e2e |

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] Every e2e test covers a complete user journey, not a UI interaction in isolation. "Click this button" is not an e2e test; "complete signup" is.
- [ ] The test environment is production-like: real UI, real backend, real database, real message bus. Recorded fakes are used only for paid or unavailable third parties.
- [ ] Wait strategy is wait-for-condition with generous timeouts everywhere. No hardcoded `sleep` calls.
- [ ] Test data is isolated per test (per-test user accounts with unique IDs, or per-test data with cleanup). Shared mutable state is the flake source.
- [ ] Each e2e test has a clear load-bearing reason for existing — names a journey that matters, asserts an outcome that would not be caught by a lower-tier test.
- [ ] Suite size and runtime are tracked. Suites trending toward 500+ tests or 30+ minutes are diagnosed; many should be lower-tier tests.
- [ ] Flake rate is monitored and held near zero. Flaky tests are diagnosed and fixed, not retried-and-ignored.
- [ ] Failure diagnostics (screenshot, video, trace) are configured so that test failures are debuggable from the CI artifacts.
- [ ] E2e tests run on every PR (critical-path subset) and on every merge or nightly (broader regression). They are not the primary test for behaviors lower-tier tests can verify.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Testing an internal seam between modules | `integration-test-design` | integration tests are cheaper and faster for non-user-journey verification |
| Testing a single unit in isolation | `testing-strategy` + `test-doubles-design` | unit-scope is much cheaper for implementation-detail verification |
| Verifying a service-to-service contract | `contract-testing` | contract tests are more targeted than e2e for service-boundary verification |
| Visual regression of a specific component | `snapshot-testing` | snapshot is cheaper and more targeted than e2e for visual regression |
| Choosing the ratio of test levels | `testing-strategy` | strategy owns ratios; this skill owns e2e-tier design |
| Measuring whether the test suite catches defects | `mutation-testing` | mutation is the test-suite quality signal; this skill is e2e tier design |
