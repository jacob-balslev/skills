# Frontend Architecture

## Coverage
Frontend architecture decides three things: where code lives (folder and module structure), what depends on what (allowed import direction), and who owns mutable state (component-local, feature-scoped, or global). This skill covers the common organizing models — feature-sliced (features/<feature>/{ui,model,api}), layered (components/, hooks/, services/, pages/), and domain-driven (domains/<domain>/{ui,logic,data}) — and the trade-offs each makes when the codebase grows from a few features to dozens.

Component layering separates primitives (no business knowledge, configurable purely through props — Button, Input, Stack), composed components (combine primitives with feature-specific layout, still no data fetching — OrderSummary, AddressForm), and connected components (own data fetching, mutation, and routing — OrderDetailPage). The boundary between composed and connected is the most common source of dependency tangles: a "shared" composed component that quietly reaches into a feature-specific store creates a back-edge that breaks the dependency graph.

State shape decisions span four axes: location (component, context, store), normalization (entity-keyed vs. nested), derivation (computed at read time vs. stored), and ownership (who can write). The shape choice determines what re-renders, what stays consistent across views, and what becomes a source of bugs when a mutation forgets to update one of several copies. Server state (data fetched from an API, cache-managed) and client state (UI-only, ephemeral) have different requirements and benefit from being managed by different tools.

Import direction enforces the architecture. A rule like "shared/ may not import from features/, and feature A may not import from feature B" is checkable with ESLint boundary plugins and tells the team at PR time when a change crosses an intended layer. Without enforcement, the structure degrades within months — a single shortcut import becomes the norm.

## Philosophy
The folder structure is not the architecture; the import graph is. A pretty folder tree with cyclic imports between features is architecturally worse than a flat folder with strict one-way dependencies. Optimize for "where would I look for this" (colocation by feature) and "what changes together stays together" (cohesion) over imposed taxonomy.

Server state and client state are different problems. Mixing them in a single store creates cache-invalidation bugs that look like rendering bugs. Use the same tool for fetching, caching, and revalidating server data; reserve global client state for genuinely cross-cutting UI concerns (theme, current user, route).

## Verification
- An import-boundary linter is configured and a CI step fails the build on violations.
- Every feature folder can be removed without touching code outside it, except a single registration point (route table, feature flag map).
- A new developer can name where any given piece of code lives within thirty seconds of being told the feature name and the kind of thing (UI vs. data vs. logic).
- Server state is fetched through one mechanism (a single query/cache library) — counting fetch call sites in client code returns approximately the number of distinct endpoints, not multiples per endpoint.
- Component props for shared primitives contain no feature-specific names; a grep for feature names in shared/ returns nothing.
- Re-render counts on a representative interaction can be measured and explained — no "this component re-renders five times and I'm not sure why."
- Tests follow the layering: primitives tested in isolation, connected components tested with mocked data layer, no test reaches across feature boundaries.

## Do NOT Use When
- The decision is visual rather than structural — color, type, spacing, motion. Use visual-design-foundations, color-system-design, or typography-system.
- The work is publishing or versioning a shared component library across multiple applications. Use design-system-architecture.
- The task is choosing or migrating a specific framework (React→Solid, Webpack→Vite). This skill is framework-neutral.
- You are designing the API the frontend consumes. Use api-design or system-interface-contracts.
- The problem is a single component's internal behavior or accessibility. Use design-module-composition, interaction-patterns, or a11y.
