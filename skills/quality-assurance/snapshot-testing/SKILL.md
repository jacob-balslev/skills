    Snapshot testing is a tactical testing technique in which the output of a system under test is *captured on a known-good run, stored as an artifact (the snapshot), and compared against fresh output on each subsequent test run*. A mismatch is the test failure. The snapshot itself is the assertion — there is *no hand-written claim about what the output should be*; the claim is *"the output should equal what it was last time, until someone deliberately approves a new baseline."* *Five primitives*: (1) *target output* — data structure / DOM tree / image / text; (2) *snapshot artifact* — stored serialized, checked into version control (or stored in a centralized service for visual snapshots); (3) *comparison and diff* — line-by-line text diff for data/DOM/text; perceptual diff with tolerance threshold for images; (4) *approval cycle* — the discipline-critical primitive: when a test fails, *read the diff*, decide whether the change was intentional, and either update the baseline (intentional) or fix the production code (unintentional); (5) *stability discipline* — timestamps, random IDs, iteration order, environment values must be normalized before capture or the test churns on noise.

    Output target matrix: *data structures* (Jest `toMatchSnapshot`, Vitest snapshot — JSON or framework-serialized), *DOM/HTML* (`@testing-library` + Jest), *images* (Chromatic, Percy, Argos, Loki, Playwright screenshots — perceptual diff with tolerance), *text/generated code* (approval-test libraries).

# Snapshot Testing

## Concept of the skill

Snapshot testing is a tactical testing technique in which the output of a system under test is *captured on a known-good run, stored as an artifact (the snapshot), and compared against fresh output on each subsequent test run*. A mismatch is the test failure. The snapshot itself is the assertion — there is *no hand-written claim about what the output should be*; the claim is *"the output should equal what it was last time, until someone deliberately approves a new baseline."* *Five primitives*: (1) *target output* — data structure / DOM tree / image / text; (2) *snapshot artifact* — stored serialized, checked into version control (or stored in a centralized service for visual snapshots); (3) *comparison and diff* — line-by-line text diff for data/DOM/text; perceptual diff with tolerance threshold for images; (4) *approval cycle* — the discipline-critical primitive: when a test fails, *read the diff*, decide whether the change was intentional, and either update the baseline (intentional) or fix the production code (unintentional); (5) *stability discipline* — timestamps, random IDs, iteration order, environment values must be normalized before capture or the test churns on noise.

Replaces hand-specifying every part of a complex output (impractical for large rendered DOM trees, JSON API responses, generated SQL, full-page visual layouts) with capture-and-compare. Solves the problem that some outputs are structurally complex enough that writing explicit assertions is prohibitively expensive — a rendered component might have hundreds of nodes; a JSON response might have dozens of fields; a generated migration might have many lines — and that small structural drift should be visible to a reviewer's eye. The technique's value is in *surfacing every subsequent change to a reviewer's eye* so that intentional changes are approved and unintentional changes are caught as regressions. Sub-purposes: (1) *characterize legacy code* as a safety net before refactoring (Feathers' original use); (2) catch *visual regressions* on UI components (Chromatic, Percy, Storybook); (3) detect *structural drift* in API responses or generated outputs over time. The technique fits where the output is structurally complex, where small drift should be visible, and *where the team will honor the approval cycle*.

Distinct from testing-strategy, which owns the strategic question of what to test at which level — this skill owns one tactical technique within that strategy. Distinct from property-based-testing, which asserts *universal* claims about output structure — snapshot captures a *specific* output and asserts equality to a baseline; the two complement (PBT for universal contracts; snapshots for complex structural outputs easier to capture than specify).

A photograph filed away without anyone ever looking at it again is not a record; it is paper. A snapshot file the team auto-accepts via `-u` is the same. The wrong mental model is that snapshot testing is "automatic regression coverage" and that running `jest -u` to update snapshots in response to failures is part of the workflow. It is not — *auto-updating without review removes the testing value*. The discipline is the *approval cycle*: when a snapshot test fails, the developer must read the diff, decide whether the change was intentional, and either approve (update the baseline) or fix the production code. A team that types `jest -u` reflexively has automated the maintenance and removed the verification.

## Coverage

The tactical testing technique in which the output of a system under test is captured on a known-good run, stored as an artifact, and compared against fresh output on each subsequent test run. Covers the five primitives (target output, snapshot artifact, comparison and diff, approval cycle, stability discipline), the taxonomy across output target (data / DOM / image / text), storage location (inline / file / centralized service), approval process (auto-update / manual edit / PR-integrated review), comparison strategy (exact / perceptual / structural / property-equality), and scope (unit / integration / full-page visual). Covers the Feathers characterization-test pattern as a legitimate use, and the auto-update-without-review anti-pattern as the technique's most common failure mode.

## Philosophy of the skill
A snapshot test is a photograph of the output. The photograph itself is not a specification — it doesn't say what the output should be, only what it was on the day of capture. The technique's value is in surfacing every subsequent change to a reviewer's eye, so that intentional changes are approved and unintentional changes are caught as regressions.

The discipline is the approval cycle. When a snapshot test fails, the developer reads the diff, decides whether the change was intentional, and either updates the baseline (intentional) or fixes the production code (unintentional). A team that types `jest -u` reflexively in response to every failing snapshot has automated the maintenance and removed the verification.

Snapshot testing fits where the output is structurally complex enough that hand-specifying every part is expensive, where small drift should be visible, and where the team will honor the approval cycle. It fits poorly where the output is simple (use precise assertions), unstable (the snapshot will churn), or where the team treats failures as nuisances to silence rather than signals to read.

## Output Target Matrix

| Target | Serialization | Diff format | Common tooling |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data structure | JSON or framework-specific | Line-by-line text diff | Jest `toMatchSnapshot`, Vitest snapshot |
| DOM / HTML | Pretty-printed HTML or virtual-DOM tree | Line-by-line text diff | `@testing-library` + Jest, Enzyme legacy |
| Image | PNG (or other lossless) | Perceptual diff with threshold | Chromatic, Percy, Argos, Loki, Playwright screenshots |
| Text | Plain text | Line-by-line text diff | Approval test libraries; framework snapshot |
| Generated code | Plain text | Line-by-line text diff | Same as text |

The target's serialization stability is the technique's precondition. Outputs that include timestamps, random IDs, iteration-order-dependent collections, or environment-dependent values must be normalized before snapshot capture or the test will churn.

## The Approval Cycle In Detail

```
Test fails (snapshot != fresh output)
            │
            ▼
   Read the diff carefully
            │
            ▼
  ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
  │                           │
  Change was intended         Change was not intended
  │                           │
  ▼                           ▼
  Update the snapshot         Fix the production code
  (the new baseline is the    (the snapshot stays;
   intended output)            the code is what changed
                               unintentionally)
```

The discipline is the read. The diff must be small enough to read, the diff format must be legible, and the developer must read it. Tooling that bypasses the read (auto-update, mass-accept) is incompatible with the technique.

## When Snapshot Testing Fits

| Fits well | Fits poorly |
|---|---|
| Complex rendered DOM components | Simple return values |
| Large JSON API responses | Single primitive outputs |
| Generated SQL or code output | Random or nondeterministic outputs |
| Visual regression of UI components | Outputs that change frequently for unrelated reasons |
| Characterizing legacy code for refactoring | Greenfield code under strict TDD |
| Full-page visual diff | Behavioral contracts that need explicit specification |
| Detecting structural drift over time | Cases where every diff is expected and uninformative |

## Stability Sources To Control

| Source | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Wall-clock timestamps | Inject a deterministic clock; freeze time in tests |
| Random IDs (UUID, nanoid) | Inject a seeded ID generator in tests |
| Iteration order of unordered collections | Sort before serialization |
| Environment-dependent values (env vars, hostnames) | Fix or mock in test environment |
| Browser/OS rendering differences (image snapshots) | Use a snapshot service that pins the environment; tolerance threshold for perceptual diff |
| Pretty-printer changes across library versions | Pin the serializer version |
| Locale-dependent formatting | Fix locale in tests |

A snapshot test on output without these controls churns on noise and trains the team to ignore the failures.

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] Every snapshot test has a designated approval cycle. The team's response to a failed snapshot test is "read the diff," not "run `-u`."
- [ ] Snapshot files are small enough that the diff between baseline and fresh output is readable by a human reviewer. Snapshots over a few hundred lines are split or replaced with per-property assertions.
- [ ] The target output is *stable* — timestamps, IDs, ordering, and environment values are controlled. Snapshots that churn on noise are diagnosed as instability, not accepted as normal.
- [ ] Snapshot tests are paired with example tests for behaviors that need specification. The suite is not snapshot-only.
- [ ] Visual snapshots use perceptual diff with a tolerance threshold, not bit-for-bit equality. The threshold is tuned to ignore rendering noise while catching real changes.
- [ ] PR review surfaces snapshot diffs; reviewers actually read them. (For visual snapshots, the snapshot service's review UI is the integration point.)
- [ ] Characterization snapshots are recognized as safety nets for legacy refactoring, not as specifications. They are progressively replaced with example or property tests as the code is understood.
- [ ] Snapshot files in source control are reviewed for size. Repository bloat from large snapshot files is a real cost that needs counterweight (technique fit, review discipline).

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Specifying one concrete behavior with explicit assertions | example tests (see `testing-strategy`) | examples specify with reasoning; snapshots capture without |
| Asserting a universal property like sort correctness | `property-based-testing` | properties assert universal claims; snapshots assert "equals last time" |
| Constructing test doubles | `test-doubles-design` | test-doubles owns the stand-in construction |
| Designing end-to-end user journey tests | `e2e-test-design` | e2e owns user-level behavioral testing; snapshot-of-screenshot is one tool inside it |
| Choosing test levels (unit/integration/e2e) | `testing-strategy` | strategy owns level choice; this skill is one tactical technique within |
| Reviewing intended visual changes against a design system | dedicated design-review process | visual design intent assessment is its own discipline; visual snapshots surface unintended changes, not whether intended ones are good |
