    Integration test design verifies the interaction between two or more units of a system — modules within a process, services across processes, layers within an architecture — to catch defects that emerge only at the boundaries between those units. The five primitives are: *boundary* (module-to-module, layer-to-layer, service-to-database, service-to-message-bus, service-to-third-party, service-to-service), *scope* (which collaborators are real, which are faked, which are out of scope), *real-vs-faked-collaborator decision per dependency* (real where the boundary's failure modes are integration-bug-finders — database, message bus, cache; faked where the realness adds cost without proportional defect-detection — paid third-party APIs, email/SMS providers), *test-data lifecycle* (full reset, transaction rollback per test, container reset, shared snapshot with no-mutation discipline), and *pyramid-vs-trophy framing* (Cohn 2009: many unit, fewer integration, fewest e2e; Dodds 2018: many integration, fewer unit, fewer e2e, static-analysis stem — integration-heavy when modern tooling makes integration cheap).

    The bug classes integration tests catch — type misalignment across serialization, transaction boundary errors, configuration mismatches, contract drift, ordering and concurrency issues at message buses, cache eviction and TTL semantics — live at the seams between units and cannot be caught by even comprehensive unit tests because unit tests by definition mock those seams. Modern infrastructure (Testcontainers for containerized real dependencies, transaction rollback for fast isolation, parallel execution within and across CI jobs, recorded fakes for stable third parties) has shifted integration-test cost down enough that the trophy framing has gained ground on the pyramid.
  # purpose: the problem this concept solves and why the field exists. One paragraph.
  purpose: |
    Replaces "comprehensive unit tests covering each unit in isolation" as the sole verification strategy with deliberate seam-verification. Solves the problem that a test suite of comprehensive unit tests has verified each unit but *not the system* — the seams are unverified, and most production failures happen at seams (database transaction boundaries, message-bus delivery semantics, third-party API contract changes, configuration drift between environments). Modern testing infrastructure has shifted integration-test cost down enough that the test trophy framing (integration-heavy suite) has gained ground on the pyramid (unit-heavy suite); the right ratio for any given codebase depends on which suite costs are real (slow tests in CI) and which are surmountable with infrastructure (containerized dependencies, transaction rollback, parallelization).

Scope failures are the dominant source of fragile integration suites. Too narrow (mocks at the actual boundary): the "integration test" is a unit test in disguise and misses the integration bugs the technique exists to catch — type misalignment, serialization edges, transaction-boundary errors are all invisible because the mock returns whatever the test author imagined the real dependency returns. Too broad (real everything including UI and unrelated services): the "integration test" is an e2e test in disguise and pays the e2e cost (slow, flaky, hard to debug) without the focused integration-test cost-benefit ratio. The discipline's central decision is *scope* — name it explicitly for each test, decide real-vs-faked per dependency on first-principles cost-benefit (is the bug class at this boundary specific to the real dependency? then real; is the real dependency unavailable, costly, or destructive? then faked), choose the test-data lifecycle pattern deliberately (transaction rollback is the default; container reset for the minority where rollback doesn't work). A persistent flake is a bug in the test design — shared mutable state, ordering dependency, time-of-day dependency, race condition — not a property to accept.

# Integration-Test Design

## Concept of the skill

Integration test design verifies the interaction between two or more units of a system — modules within a process, services across processes, layers within an architecture — to catch defects that emerge only at the boundaries between those units. The five primitives are: *boundary* (module-to-module, layer-to-layer, service-to-database, service-to-message-bus, service-to-third-party, service-to-service), *scope* (which collaborators are real, which are faked, which are out of scope), *real-vs-faked-collaborator decision per dependency* (real where the boundary's failure modes are integration-bug-finders — database, message bus, cache; faked where the realness adds cost without proportional defect-detection — paid third-party APIs, email/SMS providers), *test-data lifecycle* (full reset, transaction rollback per test, container reset, shared snapshot with no-mutation discipline), and *pyramid-vs-trophy framing* (Cohn 2009: many unit, fewer integration, fewest e2e; Dodds 2018: many integration, fewer unit, fewer e2e, static-analysis stem — integration-heavy when modern tooling makes integration cheap).

Replaces "comprehensive unit tests covering each unit in isolation" as the sole verification strategy with deliberate seam-verification. Solves the problem that a test suite of comprehensive unit tests has verified each unit but *not the system* — the seams are unverified, and most production failures happen at seams (database transaction boundaries, message-bus delivery semantics, third-party API contract changes, configuration drift between environments). Modern testing infrastructure has shifted integration-test cost down enough that the test trophy framing (integration-heavy suite) has gained ground on the pyramid (unit-heavy suite); the right ratio for any given codebase depends on which suite costs are real (slow tests in CI) and which are surmountable with infrastructure (containerized dependencies, transaction rollback, parallelization).

Distinct from testing-strategy, which owns the strategic ratio question (how much of each level) — this skill owns the design of integration-level tests specifically. Distinct from test-doubles-design, which owns the construction of mocks/stubs/fakes as constructs — this skill owns the per-dependency real-vs-faked decision in integration scope (integration tests use real where practical, fakes only at true external boundaries; mocking the database in an "integration test" is the most common scope failure). Distinct from e2e-test-design, which owns user-journey-scope tests through the full stack including UI — this skill owns the scope *below* that, interaction of units inside the system, often without UI. Distinct from contract-testing, which owns consumer-driven contract verification between services — contract tests verify the *interface*; integration tests verify the *implementation through* the interface; the two compose, one does not replace the other. Distinct from mutation-testing, which is a test-suite quality measurement applied at any level — this skill is the design of integration-level tests themselves. Distinct from snapshot-testing, which is a capture-and-compare technique applicable inside any test level. An integration test is to a software system what a fire-suppression drill in a specific corridor is to the whole building's safety plan — you are not testing whether each sprinkler head works in isolation (unit), nor whether everyone evacuates the entire building in fifteen minutes (e2e), you are testing whether the smoke detector in *this corridor* triggers the alarm panel which triggers the sprinkler which actually wets *that carpet*; the test's identity is the named boundary, and changing the named boundary changes the test's identity. The wrong mental model is that an integration test is "a unit test with more stuff in it" or "an e2e test with the UI removed." It is neither. Scope failures are the dominant source of fragile integration suites. Too narrow (mocks at the actual boundary): the "integration test" is a unit test in disguise and misses the integration bugs the technique exists to catch — type misalignment, serialization edges, transaction-boundary errors are all invisible because the mock returns whatever the test author imagined the real dependency returns. Too broad (real everything including UI and unrelated services): the "integration test" is an e2e test in disguise and pays the e2e cost (slow, flaky, hard to debug) without the focused integration-test cost-benefit ratio. The discipline's central decision is *scope* — name it explicitly for each test, decide real-vs-faked per dependency on first-principles cost-benefit (is the bug class at this boundary specific to the real dependency? then real; is the real dependency unavailable, costly, or destructive? then faked), choose the test-data lifecycle pattern deliberately (transaction rollback is the default; container reset for the minority where rollback doesn't work). A persistent flake is a bug in the test design — shared mutable state, ordering dependency, time-of-day dependency, race condition — not a property to accept.

## Coverage

The discipline of designing tests that verify the interaction between two or more units of a system — modules within a process, services across processes, layers within an architecture, services across organizational boundaries — to catch defects that emerge only at the boundaries. Covers the five primitives (boundary, scope, real-vs-faked-collaborator, test-data lifecycle, pyramid-or-trophy framing), the boundary-type taxonomy (module-to-module, layer-to-layer, service-to-database, service-to-message-bus, service-to-third-party, service-to-service), the test-data lifecycle patterns (full reset, transaction rollback, container reset, shared snapshot), and the pyramid (Cohn 2009) vs trophy (Dodds 2018) framings for how much integration testing the suite should contain. Includes Testcontainers and similar infrastructure as the modern enabler that makes integration testing cheap enough to do well.

## Philosophy of the skill
Integration tests verify the parts of a system that no individual unit can verify alone. The bugs they catch — type misalignment, serialization edge cases, transaction boundary errors, configuration mismatches, contract drift, ordering and concurrency issues — live at the boundaries between units. A test suite of comprehensive unit tests and zero integration tests has verified each unit and not the system; the seams are unverified.

The discipline's central design decision is *scope*: for each test, which collaborators are real (exercised in their integration-bug-finding form) and which are faked (replaced because their realness adds cost without proportional defect-detection). The scope determines the test's identity. Too narrow (mocks at the boundary): the "integration test" is a unit test in disguise and misses the integration bugs. Too broad (real everything, including UI): the "integration test" is an e2e test in disguise and pays the e2e cost.

Modern testing infrastructure — Testcontainers for containerized real dependencies, transaction rollback for fast isolation, parallel execution within and across CI jobs, recorded fakes for third parties — has shifted the cost of integration testing down enough that the test trophy framing (integration-heavy suite) has gained ground on the pyramid (unit-heavy suite). The right ratio for a given codebase depends on which suite costs are real and which are surmountable with infrastructure.

## The Pyramid vs The Trophy

| Framing | Suite shape | Year | Cost assumption | Best fit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Test Pyramid (Cohn) | Many unit / fewer integration / fewest e2e | 2009 | Integration tests expensive, slow, flaky | Codebases where integration infra is missing or costly |
| Test Trophy (Dodds) | Many integration / fewer unit / fewer e2e / static-analysis stem | 2018 | Integration tests cheap with modern tooling; unit tests pin implementation details | Codebases with strong integration-test infrastructure |
| Diamond | Many integration / few unit / few e2e | — | Same as trophy minus the static-analysis stem | Codebases where unit tests have lost most value vs the maintenance cost |

Both pyramid and trophy agree on: unit tests for fast feedback on implementation logic, integration tests for boundary verification, e2e tests sparingly for full-stack confidence. The disagreement is about the ratio between unit and integration, which depends on what each costs in a given codebase.

## Scope Choice — The Defining Decision

For each test, name the scope explicitly. For each dependency in scope, decide real or faked.

| Dependency | Real cost | Faked cost | Typical choice |
|---|---|---|---|
| In-process other modules | Free | Loses integration coverage | Real always |
| Database | Containerized: low (Testcontainers reuse) | In-memory variant: low; loses some real-DB bugs | Real (containerized or in-memory variant) |
| Message bus | Containerized: low | In-memory variant: loses delivery semantics | Real (containerized) for production-confidence tests |
| Cache (Redis) | Containerized: low | In-memory fake: loses eviction/TTL bugs | Real (containerized) |
| Third-party API (paid) | Per-call cost; rate limit | Recorded fake: free, may drift | Recorded fake for PR tests; real sandbox for nightly |
| Third-party API (free, stable) | Network latency; availability | Recorded fake: free | Real for nightly; recorded for PR |
| Email / SMS providers | Sends real messages — usually wrong | Capture fake: verifies the call was made | Capture fake; never real in tests |
| Authentication / OAuth | Real provider often unavailable in test | Issued-token fake | Token fake |

The decision rule: use real where the boundary's specific failure modes are integration-bug-finders (database, message bus); use fake where the dependency's realness adds cost (paid APIs) or unacceptable side effects (emails) without proportional defect-detection.

## Test Data Lifecycle Patterns

| Pattern | Speed | Isolation | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Per-test full reset (drop / recreate) | Slowest (~seconds per test) | Strongest | Tests with destructive schema changes |
| Per-test transaction rollback | Fast (milliseconds) | Strong (for transactional DBs) | Most database integration tests |
| Per-suite seed + per-test mutation isolation | Fast | Medium | Read-heavy test suites with limited mutation |
| Shared snapshot + no-mutation discipline | Fastest | Relies on team discipline | Pure read tests |
| Container reset per test (Testcontainers) | Medium (container startup) | Strongest cross-process | Tests where transaction rollback isn't viable |

The standard production setup is transaction rollback for the bulk of database integration tests, with container reset reserved for the minority where transaction rollback doesn't work (cross-database tests, tests that exercise the transaction system itself).

## When To Use Real Dependencies vs Faked

Quick decision table:

| Question | If yes | If no |
|---|---|---|
| Is the bug class you want to catch at this boundary specific to the real dependency? | Use real | Consider faked |
| Is the real dependency available in test environment? | Use real or sandbox | Use recorded fake |
| Is the real dependency's per-test cost acceptable? | Use real | Use recorded fake |
| Does the real dependency have unacceptable side effects (real emails, real charges)? | Use capture fake | n/a |
| Does the team have infrastructure for the real dependency (Testcontainers, etc.)? | Use real | Build the infra or use recorded fake |

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] Every integration test's scope is explicit: which collaborators are real, which are faked, what boundary the test exercises. Tests without explicit scope drift between unit and e2e.
- [ ] Real database, real message bus, real cache are used where their failure modes are integration-bug-finders. Mocking these dependencies usually means the test is unit-scope.
- [ ] Third-party APIs are faked (recorded responses) for fast PR tests and exercised real in scheduled (nightly/weekly) integration runs.
- [ ] Test data lifecycle is one of the named patterns (transaction rollback / container reset / per-suite seed / shared no-mutation), not ad-hoc. Test independence is a property of the lifecycle, not a hope.
- [ ] Flaky integration tests are diagnosed (shared mutable state, ordering dependency, time-of-day dependency, race condition), not accepted. A persistent flake is a bug in the test design.
- [ ] The pyramid-or-trophy ratio is intentional and reviewed against the codebase's actual integration-test cost and integration-bug rate.
- [ ] Integration tests are not used where contract tests would be more targeted. The two compose; one does not replace the other.
- [ ] Integration tests run in CI on every PR (with appropriate scope), not relegated to "nightly only" except for the slowest tier (sandbox third parties, multi-service e2e).

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Testing a single function in isolation with all collaborators mocked | `testing-strategy` + `test-doubles-design` | unit-scope test; this skill is for inter-unit scope |
| Testing a full user journey through the UI | `e2e-test-design` | user-journey scope; this skill is for internal seams |
| Verifying that a service's external interface matches the consumer's expectations | `contract-testing` | contract scope; this skill verifies implementation through the interface |
| Measuring whether the test suite catches defects | `mutation-testing` | quality measurement; this skill is the integration-test design itself |
| Choosing the overall ratio of test levels | `testing-strategy` | strategy owns ratios; this skill owns integration-test internals |
| Snapshot-capturing a complex output | `snapshot-testing` | snapshot technique; this skill is integration-test scope |
