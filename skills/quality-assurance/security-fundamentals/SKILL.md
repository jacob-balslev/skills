    Replaces "security as feature added after the system works" with "security as a property of the design from the first commit." Without security-fundamentals as a discipline, security retrofitting costs order-of-magnitude more than designing security in, produces worse results, and accumulates structural debt that compounds with each release. The discipline does not promise prevention — any non-trivial system will be attacked, and some attacks will succeed. The goal is to make attacks expensive, slow, traceable, and limited in blast radius. Every design choice is evaluated by what it costs the defender vs what it costs the attacker, and secure-by-default choices place costs on attackers rather than defenders.

Distinct from credential-encryption, which owns specific schemes for encrypted credential storage and key management — security-fundamentals owns the upstream discipline of deciding what counts as a secret and where it lives in the trust hierarchy. Distinct from security-scanning, which owns the configuration of static and dynamic analysis tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) — security-fundamentals owns the design discipline that scanning verifies.

  analogy: "Security fundamentals is to a software system what structural engineering is to a building — load-bearing walls, fire egress, electrical isolation, foundation depth are not features added after the building works; they are properties of the design from the first sketch, and retrofitting them costs ten times more and produces worse results than designing them in. A building that survives an earthquake does so because of decisions made at the structural-engineering stage, not because of decorations added later."
  # misconception: the wrong mental model people bring; corrected explicitly.
  misconception: |
    The wrong mental model is that security is a checklist of mitigations to add. It is not. Security is a property of trust boundaries and the discipline that decides where they sit. A system with twenty mitigations but unclear trust boundaries is less secure than a system with five mitigations and rigorously specified boundaries — because the mitigations cluster in the wrong places, the boundaries leak in unexpected directions, and the security argument cannot be made without the boundary map. The discipline is to think in terms of "what crosses what boundary, who controls each side, what's the cost if the boundary fails?" — and to place mitigations as derivatives of that map, not as a generic shopping list.

## Concept of the skill

**What it is:** Security fundamentals are the design principles and threat-modeling habits that decide whether a system can safely handle data, identity, and authority under adversarial conditions.

**Mental model:** Start with assets, adversaries, trust boundaries, and privileged actions. Every mitigation should be traceable to what crosses a boundary, who controls each side, what can go wrong, and how much damage remains if the boundary fails.

**Why it exists:** Security added after the system works is expensive and incomplete. Designing security in early makes attacks harder, slower, easier to detect, and smaller in blast radius.

**What it is NOT:** It is not an OWASP deep audit, LLM prompt-injection architecture, vendor webhook mechanics, scanner configuration, cryptographic primitive implementation, or legal compliance workflow.

**Adjacent concepts:** `owasp-security` owns category-specific application-security review; `prompt-injection-defense` owns LLM instruction-channel threats; `type-safety` carries validated values after boundary parsing; `api-design` and `http-semantics` shape public interfaces; `webhook-integration` owns vendor webhook mechanics.

**One-line analogy:** Security fundamentals are like structural engineering for software: load-bearing decisions must be in the design before people move in.

**Common misconception:** A pile of controls is not the same as a security argument; controls matter only when they are placed at the right trust boundaries and fail safely.

# Security Fundamentals

## Coverage

The cross-cutting design principles, threat-modeling discipline, and recurring vulnerability classes that determine whether a system can safely handle data, identity, and authority under adversarial conditions. Covers the foundational discipline upstream of any specific vulnerability or tool: Shostack's four threat-modeling questions, Saltzer and Schroeder's eight design principles (1975), trust boundaries, the authentication/authorization distinction, input validation as a boundary discipline, defense in depth, least privilege, and the OWASP Top 10 as a working enumeration of recurring failure classes. Does NOT cover the implementation of specific cryptographic primitives, the configuration of specific scanners, the regulatory artifacts of compliance regimes, the LLM-specific specialization to prompt injection, or the organizational/social side of security.

## Philosophy of the skill
Security is a property of the design, not a feature added after the system works. The cost of designing security in is small; the cost of retrofitting it is order-of-magnitude larger and produces worse results. The discipline of security fundamentals is the discipline of paying these costs early — at the threat-modeling stage, at the trust-boundary stage, at the authentication-design stage — before the system has accumulated the structural debt that makes retrofitting expensive.

The discipline does not promise prevention of attacks. Any non-trivial system will be attacked; some attacks will succeed. The goal is to make attacks expensive, slow, traceable, and limited in blast radius. Every design choice is evaluated by what it costs the defender vs what it costs the attacker. Secure-by-default choices cost the defender slightly more code upfront but cost the attacker a working exploit; opt-in security features cost the defender nothing upfront but cost the attacker very little when the developer inevitably forgets. The discipline is the deliberate placement of costs on the attacker rather than the defender.

For agents writing code, the discipline is what lets the agent reason about a security-relevant change without having to read the entire system. An agent that knows the trust boundaries, the authn/authz distinction, and the input-validation discipline can look at a new endpoint and ask: 'where is this endpoint receiving data from?' 'Is the data validated at the boundary?' 'Is authentication checked?' 'Is authorization checked at the moment of the privileged action?' 'What's the blast radius if any of these fail?' These questions produce the right code without the agent having to recall every OWASP entry.

## The Four Threat-Modeling Questions (Shostack)

| Question | What it produces | Common failure |
|---|---|---|
| **What are we working on?** | The system diagram, asset inventory, data classification, trust boundaries | Skipped; analysis proceeds against an unstated model |
| **What can go wrong?** | The threat list: STRIDE categories, attacker scenarios, abuse cases | Jumped to mitigation without enumerating threats |
| **What are we going to do about it?** | The mitigations: design choices, controls, monitoring | The bulk of effort goes here; without the first two, mitigations are random |
| **Did we do a good job?** | Verification: tests, reviews, ongoing monitoring | Declared without testing; threat model never revisited |

A team that answers all four iteratively, with each system change, is doing security fundamentals. A team that answers only three, or answers them once, is doing security theater.

## Saltzer & Schroeder's Eight Principles (1975)

These predate every modern technology and remain canonical because they describe properties, not implementations.

| Principle | One-line gloss | What it forbids |
|---|---|---|
| **Economy of mechanism** | Keep it simple | Sprawling, complex security architectures with many components |
| **Fail-safe defaults** | Deny by default; permit by exception | "is_admin defaults to true" patterns |
| **Complete mediation** | Check every access; never cache "I checked this earlier" | First-request-only auth checks; trust-on-session |
| **Open design** | Don't depend on secrecy of the design (Kerckhoffs) | Security through obscurity; secret algorithms |
| **Separation of privilege** | Require multiple independent conditions for sensitive operations | Single-credential vault access for irreversible actions |
| **Least privilege** | Minimum permissions per entity | Service accounts with admin keys; over-scoped tokens |
| **Least common mechanism** | Minimize shared mechanism across users | Global state that leaks information between requests |
| **Psychological acceptability** | Security users will bypass is not security | Onerous policies that drive workarounds (sticky-note passwords) |

## The Authn / Authz Distinction

| Concern | Question it answers | Verified by | Where it lives | When it runs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Authentication** | "Who are you?" | Credentials (password, token, certificate, MFA) | Auth middleware, login flow | At session establishment |
| **Authorization** | "Are you allowed to do this?" | Policy against identity (RBAC, ABAC, ACLs) | At every privileged action | Every request to a protected resource |

Conflating these is the #1 issue in the OWASP Top 10. The pattern: authenticate at the entry point; authorize at every privileged action. Never short-circuit authorization on the basis of having a valid session.

## Input Validation As Boundary Discipline

The pattern, in order:

1. **Define expectations.** Every input has an explicit shape, range, and meaning expectation. Document it as a schema (Zod, JSON Schema, OpenAPI).
2. **Validate at the boundary.** Validation happens at the entry point of the request, not three function calls in. The earlier validation fails, the less the system has done with bad data.
3. **Parse, don't validate (Alexis King).** Convert the untrusted value into a typed, validated value once; trust the typed form everywhere downstream. This composes with `type-safety` — the type system carries the validation forward.
4. **Treat validation failure as a response-shaped outcome.** Return a structured error (400 Bad Request with field-level detail) rather than throwing in the middle of business logic.
5. **Log validation failures.** Repeated validation failures from a specific source may be probing for vulnerabilities; logged failures feed monitoring.

| Boundary | Untrusted source | Validation discipline |
|---|---|---|
| User → application | HTTP request bodies, form inputs, query params, headers | Schema-based parsing at the entry point |
| External API → application | Webhook payloads, third-party responses, OAuth callbacks | Signature verification + schema validation |
| Database → application | (Trust your DB, but validate cross-tenant) | Org-scoped queries; row-level security |
| Client → server (API) | API requests | Schema validation + authn + authz |
| Process boundary (microservices) | Inter-service calls | mTLS or signed tokens + schema validation |
| Untrusted file → application | Uploaded files | Type detection, size limits, sandbox parsing |
| LLM → application (tool calls) | Tool arguments produced by LLM | Treat as untrusted; validate against tool schema |

## Defense In Depth — Layered Controls

| Layer | Purpose | Failure mode when missing |
|---|---|---|
| **Network** | Firewall, segmentation, WAF | Direct exposure of internal services to internet |
| **Identity** | Authn, MFA, SSO | Credential stuffing, account takeover |
| **Application authz** | RBAC/ABAC, per-action checks | Broken access control (OWASP A01) |
| **Input validation** | Schema parse, sanitize | Injection (OWASP A03) |
| **Data encryption** | At-rest, in-transit, end-to-end | Cryptographic failure (OWASP A02) |
| **Output encoding** | Escape on output (XSS, log forging) | XSS, log poisoning |
| **Rate limiting** | Throttling, anomaly detection | Brute force, scraping, DoS |
| **Logging & monitoring** | Audit trails, alerts | Undetected breach (OWASP A09) |
| **Incident response** | Playbooks, forensics, recovery | Slow response when attacks succeed |

The property of defense in depth is the *composition* — no single layer is the security; the security is what remains when one layer fails.

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] A threat model exists for the system or feature, answering all four Shostack questions; it is dated and reviewed at meaningful intervals.
- [ ] Trust boundaries are explicitly enumerated; each boundary has a validation discipline applied.
- [ ] Authentication is required at every entry point that needs identity; authorization is checked at every privileged action — not just at session start.
- [ ] Input validation happens at the trust boundary, returns structured errors, and is logged.
- [ ] Sensitive data has been classified (public, internal, confidential, restricted, secrets); each tier has handling rules; secrets are never logged or stored unencrypted.
- [ ] Service-to-service calls use mTLS or signed tokens; no service trusts another solely on network position.
- [ ] Defaults are fail-safe (deny by default; permit by explicit exception with justification).
- [ ] Every entity (user, service, process) has minimum-necessary permissions; service accounts do not have admin keys; tokens are scoped to the minimum action set.
- [ ] Sensitive actions are logged with sufficient detail to reconstruct what happened; logs are protected from modification.
- [ ] Monitoring is in place to detect anomalies and failed validations; alerts are tested.
- [ ] Cryptographic primitives are implemented by well-reviewed libraries, not custom code; keys are managed (rotation, escrow, scoped access).
- [ ] Compliance documentation (where applicable) is downstream of the security property, not a substitute for it.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Defending an LLM agent against prompt injection | `prompt-injection-defense` | prompt-injection-defense owns the LLM-specific specialization; this skill is the broader framing |
| Encrypting stored credentials (envelope encryption, KMS) | Vendor/KMS/library docs, then `owasp-security` for review | implementation mechanics are outside this active skill library; this skill owns deciding what counts as a secret |
| OWASP-category code audit or vulnerability triage | `owasp-security` | owasp-security owns category-specific security review; this skill owns the upstream design principles |
| Choosing and configuring a SAST/DAST/dependency scanner | Scanner/vendor docs, then `owasp-security` for review | scanner setup is tooling-specific; this skill owns why the scan exists |
| GDPR / data-subject rights / regulatory artifacts | Legal/compliance docs | compliance workflow is outside this active skill library; this skill owns the underlying security design properties |
| Implementing a specific cryptographic primitive (AES, RSA, hashing) | Well-reviewed crypto library docs (libsodium, BouncyCastle, native APIs) | Implementation is library territory; this skill is upstream of "which primitive" |
| Webhook signature verification for a specific platform (Shopify, Stripe) | `webhook-integration` | webhook-integration owns vendor-specific patterns; this skill provides the framing |
| Social engineering, phishing, organizational security awareness | (no skill — out of scope) | Organizational security is a separate discipline |
| Penetration testing methodology | (no skill — out of scope) | A specialized professional discipline |
