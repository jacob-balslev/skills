# Information Architecture

## Coverage

Structure information so users and agents can find, understand, and move through it. Covers navigation, sitemaps, hierarchy, page grouping, labeling systems, docs structure, cross-links, wayfinding cues, content models, and IA validation through real user tasks.

## Philosophy

Information architecture is not decoration. It is the contract between a user's goal and the system's structure. If the IA is wrong, good content and good components still feel confusing because the path to them is unclear.

Good IA starts from tasks, then chooses structure. Do not promote every important thing to top-level navigation. Do not bury frequently used workflows under technically accurate but user-invisible categories.

## Method

1. Name the top user tasks and entry points.
2. Inventory current content or screens.
3. Group by user goal first, implementation detail second.
4. Decide structure: nav item, page, tab, section, filter, or cross-link.
5. Apply label discipline: recognizable user language, stable nouns, no internal jargon.
6. Add wayfinding: current location, sibling options, next action, and escape path.
7. Test against task scenarios and no-prior-knowledge discovery.

## Evals

This skill ships a comprehension-eval artifact at [`examples/evals/information-architecture.json`](https://github.com/jacob-balslev/skill-graph/blob/main/examples/evals/information-architecture.json). The checklist below is the authoring gate for findability and structure decisions; the eval file is the grader surface.

## Verification

- [ ] Top tasks have obvious entry points
- [ ] Labels use user language rather than implementation terms
- [ ] Navigation levels are limited and predictable
- [ ] Similar content has one canonical home plus cross-links where needed
- [ ] Users can recover from a wrong turn without restarting
- [ ] Empty states and low-data states still preserve structure
- [ ] IA was tested against real task prompts

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `taxonomy-design` | You need classification governance, facets, or category assignment rules. |
| `layout-composition` | You need responsive section order, grid/flex structure, or page-level scan pattern. |
| `design-system-architecture` | You need token, theme, component API, or design-system governance. |
| `microcopy` | The structure is settled and you need wording for labels, errors, or empty states. |
| `a11y` | The primary task is accessibility compliance or assistive-technology behavior. |
