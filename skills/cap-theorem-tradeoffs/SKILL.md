# CAP-Theorem Tradeoffs

## Coverage

The consistency-availability-partition-tolerance trade-off that physics imposes on distributed data systems. Covers Brewer's 2000 conjecture, Gilbert & Lynch's 2002 formal proof, why P is mandatory in real networks (the practical choice is CP vs AP, not "any two of three"), the PACELC extension (Abadi 2010) that names the latency-vs-consistency trade-off in the non-partition case, the CAP-C vs ACID-C confusion that is the most-common misconception in the space, the spectrum of consistency models from linearizability to eventual consistency, the four PACELC quadrants (PA/EL, PA/EC, PC/EL, PC/EC) and the systems that occupy each, and the partition-mode choice procedure.

## Philosophy

CAP is the frame that made distributed-systems design honest. Before Brewer's 2000 conjecture and Gilbert & Lynch's 2002 proof, the industry made contradictory claims about consistency, availability, and fault tolerance; after CAP, those claims have shape. Under partition — which physics guarantees will happen — you preserve consistency at the cost of availability, or availability at the cost of consistency.

The discipline is making the choice *per workload* and *intentionally*. A banking core ledger is right to be CP. A shopping cart's session state is right to be AP. A multi-region content-delivery system is right to be AP with eventual consistency. A schema registry is right to be CP. The choice is the engineering team's responsibility; CAP names the trade-off; the design realizes the choice.

PACELC is the frame that made CAP practical. Most systems spend the overwhelming majority of their time *not* partitioned; PACELC's E (else) case names the latency-vs-consistency trade-off in the common case, which is where most users' actual experience lives. A team that designs for CAP without PACELC has optimized for the rare event and ignored the daily one.

## The CAP Theorem In One Diagram

```
                    During a network partition,
                    pick at most TWO of:

                    Consistency (C)
                          /\
                         /  \
                        / CP \       Common: Spanner, etcd,
                       /  ↓   \         MongoDB w/ majority,
                      / refuse \             ZooKeeper
                     /  some    \
                    /  requests  \
                   /              \
                  /                \
                 /                  \
                /                    \
               /         AP           \
              /  serve all requests    \
             /   accept stale reads     \    Common: Cassandra default,
            /   diverge on writes        \      DynamoDB default,
           /                              \              Riak
          /                                \
         /__________________________________\
       Availability (A)        Partition tolerance (P)

   "CA" is not a real choice — partitions happen.
```

## CAP-C vs ACID-C — A Worked Example

A multi-region banking system with eventual consistency:

| Scenario | CAP-C status | ACID-C status |
|---|---|---|
| Both replicas show balance = $500 (constraint: balance ≥ 0) | Consistent | Consistent |
| Replica A shows $500, replica B shows $400 (constraint: balance ≥ 0) | INconsistent (CAP) | Consistent (no constraint violated) |
| Both replicas show balance = -$100 (constraint: balance ≥ 0) | Consistent | INconsistent (constraint violated) |
| Replica A shows balance = -$100, replica B shows $500 | INconsistent (CAP) | INconsistent (replica A violates) |

The two C's measure different things. The system needs both to be operationally correct.

## PACELC Quadrants

| Quadrant | Partition behavior | Else (steady-state) behavior | Example systems |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PA/EL** | AP | Latency over consistency | Cassandra default, DynamoDB default, MongoDB default |
| **PA/EC** | AP | Consistency over latency | Rare; often misconfiguration |
| **PC/EL** | CP | Latency over consistency | Some real-world systems (mixed mode) |
| **PC/EC** | CP | Consistency over latency | Spanner, Cosmos DB strong, MongoDB w/ majority-read |

Choosing for the steady-state matters more than choosing for partition in most workloads.

## The Choice Procedure

1. **What does the system do if data goes stale by 10 seconds during a partition?** If the answer is "users see slightly old data; we reconcile later" — AP is viable. If the answer is "we lose money / corrupt records / fail an SLA" — CP is required.

2. **What does the system do if 50% of requests fail for 60 seconds during a partition?** If "users retry; we lose some requests" — CP is viable. If "we churn users / lose orders / break business" — AP is required.

3. **In the steady state, do we want low latency (EL) or strong consistency (EC)?** This is the dominant question for most workloads, since partition is rare. Strong consistency in the common case requires synchronous replication; eventual consistency in the common case allows asynchronous.

4. **Does the workload need linearizability, or is causal consistency / read-your-writes enough?** Many workloads need weaker consistency than CAP's linearizability; the choice of consistency model affects the system's achievable throughput.

5. **Is the system actually distributed?** Single-node or single-region tightly-coupled systems may not have CAP concerns at all. Avoid invoking CAP for systems where it doesn't apply.

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] The team distinguishes CAP-C (replica agreement) from ACID-C (constraint satisfaction) in design discussions. Using "consistency" without qualifier produces confused decisions.
- [ ] The system's CP-or-AP choice is explicit, documented, and tied to the workload's tolerance for stale data vs unavailability.
- [ ] The PACELC quadrant is identified for the system. The steady-state latency-vs-consistency trade-off is treated as the dominant design decision, not as an afterthought to CAP.
- [ ] Partition-mode behavior is tested, not assumed. The team has actually exercised partition (chaos engineering, network-partition simulation) and verified the system behaves as designed.
- [ ] Reconciliation logic is in place for AP systems. Eventual consistency requires the team to have a defined convergence strategy (vector clocks, CRDTs, last-write-wins, anti-entropy) and to have tested it.
- [ ] No system claims "CA" without challenge. CA is not a real choice; systems that claim it have not actually been tested under partition.
- [ ] For tunable systems (Cassandra, DynamoDB), the per-operation consistency choice is intentional. The default settings are not assumed correct without verification per workload.
- [ ] The consistency model is named (linearizability, causal, read-your-writes, eventual). "Strong consistency" without specification is imprecise.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Reasoning about single-node transactional guarantees | `acid-fundamentals` | acid-fundamentals owns single-system; this owns distributed |
| Choosing an isolation level for concurrent transactions | `transaction-isolation` | transaction-isolation owns single-cluster concurrency |
| Designing replication topology (primary-replica, multi-primary, etc.) | `replication-patterns` | replication-patterns owns the operational realization of CAP choices |
| Sharding decisions for horizontal scaling | `sharding-strategy` | sharding owns horizontal partitioning; this owns the consistency frame across shards |
| Tuning a query for performance | `query-optimization` | query-optimization owns retrieval performance |
| Designing for high availability without distributed concerns | high-availability or reliability skills | HA on a single node is not a CAP concern |
