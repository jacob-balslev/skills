# Component Architecture

## Coverage

The architectural discipline of structuring a library of UI components so they can be reused across products, themes, and teams. Covers the layering of primitives, composites, and product-specific assemblies; the composition-over-configuration principle and its trade-offs; the headless/styled split as the mechanism for behavior reuse across visual languages; controlled / uncontrolled / hybrid state contracts; the open-closed principle adapted to component evolution; polymorphism via `as` and `asChild`; extension mechanisms (props, children, slots, render props, compound components, ref forwarding); and the API-as-contract framing that makes component libraries survive multi-product, multi-year reuse.

## Philosophy

The component's API is the contract between its author and every future consumer. Every prop, every slot, every event is a public surface that becomes a thing future versions must continue to support — or break consumers. Component architecture is the discipline of designing those contracts with the knowledge that you cannot predict every consumer and that the contract will be inhabited by integrations you didn't anticipate.

The discipline is upstream of any specific library, framework, or visual language. Layering, composition, the headless/styled split, the controlled/uncontrolled distinction, and the open-closed principle are properties of how components are *structured* — independent of which framework implements them and which design tokens style them. A team that internalizes these properties produces libraries that survive a decade of framework changes, brand refreshes, and product evolution. A team that does not produces libraries that work for the first product and require a rewrite for the second.

For agents working in component-heavy codebases, the discipline is the framework that lets the agent reason locally. Pick up a component, classify it by layer (primitive / composite / product-specific), inspect its API surface (props, slots, events), identify its state contract (controlled / uncontrolled / hybrid), and use it correctly without internalizing every idiosyncrasy. Without the framework, the agent pattern-matches against whatever the codebase already does — which means proliferating the codebase's existing architectural mistakes.

## The Layering Principle

| Layer | What it is | Change rate | Reuse scope | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Primitive** | Smallest reusable unit; behavior only or behavior + minimal styling | Rare | All products | Button, Input, Checkbox, Popover, Dialog Root |
| **Composite** | Combines primitives into recurring patterns | Moderate | Most products | FormField (label + input + error), Card, DataTable |
| **Product-specific assembly** | Combines composites into unique product surfaces | Frequent | One product | CheckoutForm, SettingsPanel, DashboardWidget |

Dependencies flow downward (composites depend on primitives; assemblies depend on composites). Reversing the flow couples primitives to specific use cases and destroys reuse.

## Composition Over Configuration

| Pattern | When to use | What it costs | What it scales |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Configuration (props)** | Small closed enum of variations; combinations are independent | Each new prop is more API surface; combinations multiply | Acceptable up to ~5-7 independent props; gets dangerous beyond |
| **Composition (children, slots, sub-components)** | Open-ended variation; structure matters | More code at each consumer; more concepts | Scales indefinitely; new variations are additive, not multiplicative |

Refactor sign: a configured component with >10 props that are mostly independent is a candidate for the compound-component refactor.

## The Headless / Styled Split

| Layer | Owns | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Headless** | Keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA, internal state, event emission | Radix Primitives, Headless UI, Ariakit, React Aria, Tanstack Table |
| **Styled** | Visual treatment, layout, spacing, typography binding | shadcn/ui (Radix + Tailwind), Mantine, MUI theme, your design system |

The split is the architectural mechanism that solves cross-product reuse when the same interaction patterns must look different in different products. Behavior evolves independently of styling; styling evolves independently of behavior.

## State Contract Patterns

| Contract | Who owns value | API shape | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Controlled** | Consumer | `value` + `onChange` | Value participates in larger state (form, store, URL) |
| **Uncontrolled** | Component (internal) | `defaultValue` + `onChange` (event-shaped) | Value is the component's business alone |
| **Hybrid** | Both supported | Both `value` (controlled path) and `defaultValue` (uncontrolled path) | Default for any new component; serves both consumer kinds |
| **Imperative-only** | Refs and methods | `ref.current.play()`, etc. | Rare; for cases where declarative APIs are awkward (video, focus) |

Default to hybrid. Consumers choose by passing `value` or `defaultValue`.

## Extension Mechanisms

| Mechanism | What it opens | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Props (config)** | Closed set of variations | Variations are small, closed, combinatorially independent |
| **Children / slots** | Structure | Consumer composes inner content |
| **Compound components** (`Dialog.Root`, `Dialog.Trigger`, `Dialog.Content`) | Structure + implicit shared state via context | Multi-part components with structural variation |
| **Render props / render functions** | Rendering | Consumer overrides how something renders, with access to internal state |
| **Forward refs / imperative handles** | Imperative access | Escape hatch for cases declarative APIs cannot reach (focus, scroll, play) |
| **Polymorphism (`as` / `asChild`)** | Element type | Consumer chooses the semantic tag rendered |

## The Polymorphism Patterns

| Pattern | Syntax | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`as` prop** | `<Button as="a" href="...">` | React-idiomatic; familiar | Hard to type correctly; doesn't compose well across libraries |
| **`asChild`** (Radix) | `<Button asChild><a href="...">...</a></Button>` | Cleaner accessibility; consumer sees the semantic element | Unfamiliar at first encounter |
| **Slot-based** (Vue, Svelte) | Framework slot mechanism | Native framework support | Limited to that framework |

For cross-library compatibility in React, `asChild` (and the underlying Radix Slot pattern) has become the modern default.

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] Each component has been classified by layer (primitive / composite / product-specific); the dependency direction is downward only.
- [ ] Configuration-explosion candidates (components with many independent boolean/enum props) have been considered for composition refactors.
- [ ] Headless behavior is separated from styled presentation when the component is intended for cross-product or cross-theme reuse.
- [ ] State contracts are deliberate (controlled / uncontrolled / hybrid / imperative); the default is hybrid for inputs.
- [ ] Polymorphic components use a deliberate pattern (`as` or `asChild`) — not an accidental any-tag escape hatch.
- [ ] Compound components share state via context and document the requirement that sub-components live within the parent.
- [ ] Accessibility (keyboard, focus, ARIA, screen-reader announcement) is built into the primitive layer, not retrofitted.
- [ ] The API surface is documented (every prop, every slot, every event, every imperative method) and stable; breaking changes follow a deprecation cycle.
- [ ] Tokens (color, spacing, type) are the binding mechanism for visual properties, not hardcoded values; the styled layer binds to tokens, not literals.
- [ ] The component library has been tested with multiple actual consumers (multiple products, multiple themes) to verify reusability claims.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Wiring a specific product's screens from components | `design-module-composition` | design-module-composition owns within-product assembly; this skill owns the components being assembled |
| Designing the design system's overall structure (tokens, foundations, governance, distribution) | `design-system-architecture` | design-system-architecture owns meta-structure; this skill owns the component stratum |
| Picking the design language (color, type, spacing decisions) | `visual-design-foundations` | visual-design-foundations owns the language; this skill owns the structural mechanism delivering it |
| Deciding where component state lives across the app | `state-management` | state-management owns location and ownership; this skill owns the component's state-contract API surface |
| Picking React hook patterns for internal component state | Library docs (React, Vue, etc.) | Tactical implementation; below this skill |
| Designing the app's folder structure | `folder-structure` or `frontend-architecture` | This skill cares about components, not where they live on disk |
| Component-level accessibility audit | `a11y` | a11y owns the discipline of checking accessibility; this skill bakes the property into the architecture |
| Form-specific component architecture (validation, submit) | `form-ux-architecture` | form-ux-architecture owns the form-specific patterns; this skill is the broader framing |
