# Replication Patterns

## Coverage

The catalog of replication topologies and the operational discipline that makes them work in production. Covers the three foundational topologies (single-leader / primary-replica, multi-leader / multi-primary, leaderless / quorum), the synchrony spectrum (sync, semi-sync, async, quorum-sync), the mechanism choices (statement-based, row-based, trigger-based, logical, physical), the read-after-write consistency problem and its mitigations (sticky session, read-from-leader, monotonic reads, version tokens), the failover model and quorum-based split-brain prevention, the conflict-resolution choices in multi-leader and leaderless systems (LWW, CRDTs, vector clocks, application merge), and the relationship to the CAP/PACELC choices the topology realizes.

## Philosophy

Replication is the discipline that gives a database fault tolerance, read scaling, and disaster recovery — at the cost of consistency-handling, conflict resolution, and operational complexity.

The default starting point is single-leader with asynchronous replication: simple, well-understood, sufficient for most read-mostly workloads. The departures from this default — multi-leader, leaderless, synchronous, geographic — each address a specific requirement (multi-region writes, strong consistency under partition, RPO=0) and add proportional complexity.

The most common production failures are not in the replication topology itself but in the application's handling of its consequences: stale reads producing user-visible bugs, split brain producing silent data divergence, failover producing unrehearsed surprises. The discipline is treating replication as an architecture the application is co-designed with, not a database feature that handles itself.

## Topology Selection

| Topology | Best for | Trade-offs |
|---|---|---|
| Single-leader, async | Read-heavy workloads with tolerance for stale reads | Replication lag; possible data loss on leader failure |
| Single-leader, sync | Workloads requiring RPO=0 | Write latency; replica failure can block writes |
| Multi-leader | Multi-region writes; active-active disaster recovery | Conflict resolution complexity |
| Leaderless (quorum) | High availability with tunable consistency | Read latency = slowest of R; quorum-sizing decisions |
| Synchronous via Raft/Paxos (Spanner, CockroachDB) | Strong consistency at scale | High write latency for distant replicas |

The starting point for most workloads is single-leader async; depart from this default only when the workload requires it.

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous Trade-off

| Property | Synchronous | Asynchronous |
|---|---|---|
| Write latency | Higher (waits for replica) | Lower (acks immediately) |
| RPO (data loss on failure) | Zero | Up to lag window |
| Read consistency from replicas | Strong | Eventual |
| Replica failure impact | Can block writes | None |
| Use case | High-stakes financial transactions, strong-RPO systems | Most production read-replicas |

Semi-sync (wait for one replica with timeout-to-async fallback) is the middle ground; production-default for many systems.

## Read-After-Write Mitigations

| Mitigation | How it works | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Read-from-leader for a window after write | Client routes back to leader for N seconds | Loses read scaling for write-heavy users |
| Sticky session | Client always reads from same replica | Replica failure invalidates session |
| Monotonic reads | Client tracks last-seen version; replica must be ≥ that fresh | Requires version-token plumbing |
| Wait-for-replica | Client waits until replica catches up | Adds latency to the read |
| Accept stale reads | Application tolerates staleness | Only viable when stale data is OK |

Every read-mostly workload with async replicas must choose one. Defaulting to "read from any replica" produces stale-data bugs.

## Failover and Split-Brain Prevention

| Mechanism | Split-brain risk | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| Manual operator failover | None (if procedure is correct) | Small / legacy systems |
| Heuristic auto-failover (no quorum) | High under partition | Older Postgres tools (without proper consensus) |
| Quorum-based promotion (Raft / Paxos) | Eliminated by majority requirement | Modern HA tools (Patroni, etcd, CockroachDB internal) |
| STONITH fencing | Old leader killed; cannot continue writing | Pacemaker / Corosync HA |

A system that must not split-brain uses quorum-based promotion. The cost is requiring an odd number of voting nodes ≥ 3.

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] The replication topology is intentional and documented: single-leader / multi-leader / leaderless; sync / async / semi-sync; physical / logical / trigger-based.
- [ ] Read-after-write consistency is handled explicitly. Sticky session, read-from-leader, monotonic reads, version tokens, or accept-stale is a named choice.
- [ ] Replication lag is monitored. Lag thresholds trigger alerts before users notice.
- [ ] Failover procedure is documented, tested, and rehearsed. Untested failover is failover that fails first time.
- [ ] Split-brain prevention uses quorum-based promotion for any system requiring it. Heuristic failover is recognized as risky.
- [ ] Backups exist separately from replication. Replica state and backup state are distinguished.
- [ ] For multi-leader: the conflict resolution mechanism (LWW / CRDT / vector clocks / app merge) is defined and tested with concurrent-write scenarios.
- [ ] For leaderless: W and R values are chosen for the workload's consistency-vs-latency target; W+R>N if strong consistency is required.
- [ ] Cross-region replication latency is measured and accepted as part of the design budget.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Horizontally partitioning data across nodes | `sharding-strategy` | sharding partitions data; replication copies it |
| Reasoning about the CAP/PACELC theoretical frame | `cap-theorem-tradeoffs` | CAP names the trade-off; this skill realizes it |
| Single-node transactional guarantees | `acid-fundamentals` | ACID is the single-system frame |
| Choosing isolation levels | `transaction-isolation` | transaction-isolation owns concurrency; this owns multi-node |
| Indexing | `indexing-strategy` | indexing is within-node retrieval |
| Tuning a slow query | `query-optimization` | query-optimization is per-query |
