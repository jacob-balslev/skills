# Taxonomy Design

## Coverage

Design controlled classification systems for skills, docs, product catalogs, navigation trees, knowledge graphs, and tags. Covers hierarchy shape, facet selection, synonym control, category granularity, assignment rules, governance, and drift cleanup. Use SKOS-grade distinctions: broader/narrower for hierarchy, related for association, preferred labels for canonical terms, alternate labels for aliases.

## Philosophy

A taxonomy is a retrieval contract. It should make things findable by the people or agents who browse it, not mirror the author's private mental map. The main failure mode is mixing incompatible organizing principles: by audience, by tool, by lifecycle phase, by domain, and by risk all in the same tree.

Prefer shallow, stable, mutually understandable structure. Add facets when one tree cannot express all valid access paths. Do not turn every semantic relation into a hierarchy.

## Method

1. Name the retrieval tasks: what questions must the taxonomy answer?
2. Choose one primary organizing principle for the tree: domain, activity, artifact, lifecycle, or risk.
3. Move secondary dimensions into facets or tags.
4. Apply the substitution test to every parent-child pair: every child must be a kind of the parent.
5. Define assignment rules for ambiguous cases.
6. Add canonical labels and aliases; never let synonyms become sibling categories.
7. Test with real items and real prompts; count "misc", duplicates, and uncertain assignments.

## Verification

- [ ] Every child category passes the IS-A substitution test against its parent
- [ ] Sibling categories share the same organizing principle
- [ ] Cross-cutting concerns are facets/tags, not duplicated branches
- [ ] Canonical labels and aliases are explicit
- [ ] Ambiguous assignment rules are written down
- [ ] No category exists only because one item needed somewhere to go
- [ ] Real items can be placed without using a catch-all bucket

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `ontology-modeling` | You need formal class/property axioms, RDF/OWL semantics, or automated reasoning. |
| `knowledge-modeling` | You are still choosing between graph, frame, rule, concept-map, or hybrid representations. |
| `semantic-relations` | You only need to type the relation between two concepts. |
| `information-architecture` | You are arranging pages, navigation, labels, and wayfinding for a user-facing experience. |
