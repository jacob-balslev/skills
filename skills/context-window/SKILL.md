# Context Window

## Coverage

The quantitative discipline behind an agent's working memory. Allocates the context-window budget across three zones: System (system prompt, rules, tool schemas), Skill Injection (the SKILL.md files auto-loaded for the current task), and Working (conversation, tool results, file contents, agent output). Names the three context health states — `ok` (< 60% used), `compact` (60–80%), `exhausted` (> 80%) — and the **80% compaction rule** that compaction must always trigger before the budget is fully consumed, leaving 20% as the safety margin for finishing the current operation, writing the checkpoint, running the closeout protocol, and emitting the continuation signal. Specifies the pre-compact protocol (commit uncommitted changes, write the continuation signal, update the checkpoint, save state that cannot be re-derived from git or disk) and the post-compact recovery flow (re-injection of git status, active-task reference, recent commits, critical findings). Catalogs typical token consumption per operation type (full file read 20–40K, large tool-result JSON 10–30K, single SKILL injection 3–8K, fixed system overhead) and the five token-reduction techniques: deterministic-CLI over heavy MCP / tool-result paths, targeted file reads with `offset` + `limit` instead of full-file reads, search-before-read (grep first, read the match), progressive skill disclosure (small SKILL.md kept always loaded; large reference files loaded on demand), and count-mode for exploration (count matches, then read the few that matter). Specifies the cross-session persistence hierarchy — git history > files on disk > durable memory > live context — and uses it to decide _what to checkpoint_ before compaction. Lists per-model-class context strategies for 1M, 200K, and 128K windows.

## Philosophy

The context window is the agent's _working memory_. Unlike human memory, it has a hard ceiling — when it fills, information is permanently lost from the live session unless it has been checkpointed somewhere durable. Managing the window is not optional. It is the difference between completing a long task and crashing mid-work with the most recent reasoning gone.

The trap of large windows is the assumption that they are _effectively_ unlimited. A 1M-token window feels infinite until a single 2000-line file read consumes 30K, three of those plus a long tool-result chain pushes past 200K, and the agent is at 60% before any real implementation has happened. The ceiling is real, and it is closer than the headline number suggests. Discipline at 200K is identical to discipline at 1M; only the absolute numbers move.

The 80% rule exists because compaction is _itself_ an operation that needs budget. Hitting 100% mid-operation loses the operation. Compacting at 80% preserves it — the remaining 20% pays for the act of preserving.

## Zone Model

A useful per-session mental partition of the available budget:

| Zone                | Typical share | What lives here                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **System**          | ~5–10%        | System prompt, repo rules, tool schemas, always-loaded directives        |
| **Skill injection** | ~2–5%         | The SKILL.md files auto-loaded by the routing layer for the current task |
| **Working**         | ~85–93%       | Conversation, tool results, file contents, agent output                  |

The exact share varies by model, harness, and task type. The zones are useful because budget breaches show up in different places: a System overrun is a rules / tool-schema problem, a Skill overrun is a routing / over-injection problem, a Working overrun is a context-management / file-read problem. Each has a different remediation.

### Practical budget by model class

Replace these illustrative figures with the actual figures of your runtime — they shift over time and across vendors.

| Model class                                                  | Total context | Typical system overhead | Practical working budget |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Frontier 1M-context (Anthropic Opus / Sonnet 1M tier)        | ~1,000,000    | ~70K                    | ~930K                    |
| Frontier 200K-context (default tier of most frontier models) | ~200,000      | ~70K                    | ~130K                    |
| Long-context Haiku class                                     | ~200,000      | ~50K                    | ~150K                    |
| ~128K class (some OpenAI / open-weight)                      | ~128,000      | ~20K                    | ~108K                    |

## Context Health States

| State       | Used budget | Meaning          | Action                                           |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `ok`        | < 60%       | Normal operation | Continue working                                 |
| `compact`   | 60–80%      | Getting crowded  | Plan compaction at the next logical boundary     |
| `exhausted` | > 80%       | Critical         | Stop after the current item, compact immediately |

### The 80% rule

**Always compact at 80% of the working budget — never at 100%.** The remaining 20% is the safety margin for:

- Completing the operation currently in flight
- Writing the checkpoint state
- Running whatever session-closeout / wrap protocol the runtime ships
- Emitting the continuation signal so the next session can resume

Hitting 100% mid-operation loses work. Compacting at 80% preserves it.

## Compaction Protocol

### When to compact

1. Context health reaches `compact` or `exhausted`
2. After completing a logical unit of work (one task, one file, one audit item)
3. Before starting a large new operation that will read many files
4. When tool results begin to truncate (a leading indicator of context pressure)

### Pre-compact checklist

Before triggering compaction:

1. **Commit any uncommitted changes** — git work survives compaction; live context does not.
2. **Write the continuation signal** — the next-session contract: active task, current question, remaining work.
3. **Update any loop or task checkpoint** — advance the recorded phase to the actual phase.
4. **Save critical state** — anything that cannot be re-derived from git history or files on disk goes into a durable artefact now.

### Pre-compact hook

A pre-compact hook is the deterministic enforcer of the checklist. The hook captures, at minimum:

- The active task identifier and the current question
- The agent mode / phase
- The current git branch and the most recent commit hashes
- The current context-health state
- A small bag of custom state (whatever the runtime needs to resume)

Any runtime that supports compaction without a pre-compact hook is _one accidental compaction away from losing the decision trail_. The hook is not optional infrastructure for any session that runs more than a few minutes.

### Post-compact recovery

After compaction, the session-start brief should re-inject:

- Git status (branch, recent commits, dirty files)
- The active task pulled from the continuation signal
- A short summary of the in-progress board state
- Any critical findings recorded in the pre-compact checkpoint

The agent does not re-load the lost conversation. It rebuilds _selectively_ from the durable artefacts.

## Token Consumption Patterns

### What consumes the most context

| Operation                           | Typical tokens | Impact     |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| Full file read (2000 lines)         | 20–40K         | High       |
| Grep results, 50 matches            | 5–10K          | Medium     |
| Tool result, large JSON             | 10–30K         | High       |
| Skill injection, one SKILL.md       | 3–8K           | Low–Medium |
| Agent response, code + explanation  | 2–5K           | Low        |
| System prompt + always-loaded rules | ~50K (fixed)   | Baseline   |

### Five token-reduction techniques

#### 1. Deterministic CLI over heavy tool-result paths

Where the runtime offers both a heavy tool-result path (e.g., a large MCP-style JSON dump) and a deterministic CLI / scripted path that returns the same data shaped tighter, prefer the CLI. The savings can easily be 50–100× per call. The principle: ship structured output through tools the model can read efficiently, not through whatever path the runtime happens to expose by default.

#### 2. Targeted file reads (offset + limit)

```
BAD:  read the whole 2000-line file
      → 30K tokens
GOOD: read 30 lines starting at the function you actually need
      → 500 tokens
```

If a code-search step has already located the relevant lines, _use_ those line numbers. A "read everything because I might need it" pattern is the single biggest avoidable burn.

#### 3. Search before read

```
BAD:  read 5 candidate files looking for a function
      → 100K tokens
GOOD: grep for the function name first, then read 30 lines from the one match
      → 2K tokens
```

The search step costs ~1K tokens and replaces 50–100K of speculative reading.

#### 4. Progressive skill disclosure

Skills should follow a two-tier structure:

- **`SKILL.md`** — the core patterns, the routing-contract description, the verification checklist. Always loaded when the skill is selected. Should fit comfortably in 3–8K tokens.
- **`references/*.md`** — detailed reference material, long examples, deep specifications. Loaded _only_ when explicitly needed.

Only `SKILL.md` is auto-injected. References are loaded by the agent when the task demands the depth.

#### 5. Count mode for exploration

```
BAD:  list every TODO comment in the repo, full match content
      → 50K tokens
GOOD: count first, then read selectively
      grep --count "TODO"                                  → 200 tokens
      grep "TODO" path: src/lib/ --head 10                 → 2K tokens
```

Exploration should be a _count → narrow → read_ sequence, not a single exhaustive read.

## Cross-Session Persistence Hierarchy

What survives a compaction or session restart, ranked from most to least durable:

1. **Git** — code, commits, branches. Permanent.
2. **Files on disk** — checkpoints, continuation signals, structured logs (JSONL is ideal). Persistent until manually deleted.
3. **Durable memory** — index files and topic files in a memory directory consumed by the next session. Persistent and indexed.
4. **Live context** — conversation history, in-flight reasoning, tool results. **Lost on compaction.**

The hierarchy drives the pre-compact checklist: anything that lives only at level 4 needs to be promoted to levels 1–3 _before_ compaction, or it is gone.

### Planning for compaction

When starting a complex multi-step task:

1. Break it into subtasks each of which can complete inside one context window
2. After each subtask: commit + update checkpoint + write continuation signal
3. If a subtask risks exceeding the budget mid-flight, split further or read fewer files

The rhythm is: small unit → commit → checkpoint → next unit. Compaction becomes a routine boundary instead of a crisis.

## Per-Model-Class Strategies

| Model class                                 | Typical task sizing                                     | Compaction cadence      | Key disciplines                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1M context (frontier Opus / Sonnet 1M tier) | 5–10 file reads + full implementation per session       | After 3–4 complex tasks | Progressive skill disclosure; targeted reads still required             |
| 200K context (default frontier tier)        | 2–4 file reads + one focused implementation per session | After every 2 tasks     | Aggressive search-before-read; skill targeting; offset+limit reads      |
| Long-context Haiku class                    | 2–3 file reads per task                                 | After every task        | Minimise skill payload; targeted labels only; commit between tasks      |
| ~128K class                                 | 1 task per session                                      | Hard boundary           | Count-mode first; read only essentials; one verification step at a time |

A 1M window is not a license to ignore the rules — it just shifts the breaking point further out. Apply the same discipline; the budget math just lets you run longer between compactions.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern                                             | Why it fails                                                               | Correct                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reading entire large files when 30 lines would do        | Burns 20–40K per file with no benefit                                      | Use `offset` + `limit`                                                             |
| Loading every available skill regardless of task         | Skill injection should be 2–5%, not 25%                                    | Use targeted routing labels; trust the routing layer                               |
| Ignoring the `compact` health signal                     | Skipping past 80% guarantees a 100% loss event sooner or later             | Compact at the next logical boundary once `compact` triggers                       |
| Compacting without a pre-compact checkpoint              | The decision trail is lost; the next session re-derives wrong              | Always run the pre-compact checklist; keep the hook always-on                      |
| Letting tool results dump unstructured JSON into context | A 30K tool result evicts 30K of useful conversation                        | Wrap heavy results in a CLI / script that returns the shape you need               |
| Speculative reads ("I might need this")                  | Speculation has the same cost as evidence-based reads, with worse outcomes | Read on evidence; if you cannot name _what you'll do with the file_, don't read it |
| Treating the 1M window as effectively unlimited          | A complex task crosses 60% in minutes; the ceiling is real                 | Apply the same discipline at 1M as at 200K; the budget just stretches              |

## Verification

- [ ] The current context-health state has been correctly classified as `ok`, `compact`, or `exhausted` based on actual usage estimates
- [ ] The pre-compact checklist has been followed before any compaction (commit, continuation signal, checkpoint, custom state)
- [ ] A pre-compact hook is installed and runs deterministically — compaction is never invoked without it firing
- [ ] File reads use `offset` + `limit` targeting for any file beyond ~200 lines
- [ ] The session prefers deterministic CLI / scripted tool paths over heavy MCP-style result dumps where both exist
- [ ] No compaction has been triggered at 100% — the 80% rule has been respected
- [ ] What needs to survive the session has been promoted from live context to git / files / durable memory before any compaction
- [ ] The active model's actual context budget (not assumed budget) is the planning baseline
