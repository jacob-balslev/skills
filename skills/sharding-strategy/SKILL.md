# Sharding Strategy

## Coverage

The discipline of dividing a database's data across multiple nodes through horizontal partitioning. Covers the three foundational partitioning schemes (range, hash, directory), consistent hashing as the refinement that solves the resharding problem, the shard-key choice as the most consequential design decision, the cross-shard query and transaction trade-offs, the catalog of failure modes (hot shard, skewed distribution, range-boundary overload), the relationship to replication (sharding divides; replication copies; they compose), and the rule that sharding is one of the last optimizations to reach for after replication, caching, and denormalization.

## Philosophy

Sharding is the scaling tool of last resort. Replication scales reads; caching reduces load; denormalization eliminates joins; vertical scaling adds capacity. When write throughput, storage capacity, or geographic data placement exceeds what those tools provide, sharding becomes the answer.

The shard key is the most consequential design decision. It determines which queries are fast (single-shard) and which are slow (scatter-gather), which operations are atomic (single-shard) and which require distributed commit (cross-shard), which growth patterns hotspot and which balance. A team that chooses the shard key well gains nearly linear scaling; a team that chooses it poorly pays operational complexity without capacity gain.

The schema must be designed with sharding in mind from the start, or significant refactoring is required when sharding is later introduced. Queries must filter on the shard key; related data must be co-located on the same shard; cross-shard operations must be rare or accepted as slow. Sharding is a schema architecture, not just an operational technique.

## The Three Partitioning Schemes

| Scheme | How it routes | Strong for | Weak for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Range | Contiguous key ranges per shard | Range queries (`BETWEEN x AND y`) | Hotspots at range boundaries; resharding by split |
| Hash | Hash(key) % N | Even balance; no range hotspots | Range queries become scatter-gather; resharding rehashes |
| Consistent hashing | Hash ring; key → nearest clockwise shard | Adding shards moves only 1/N of data | Range queries still scatter-gather |
| Directory | Explicit map per key | Flexibility; arbitrary routing | The directory itself becomes a bottleneck |

Hash with consistent hashing is the default for most large-scale systems; range partitioning is used for time-series and naturally-ordered data; directory is rare but useful for arbitrary placement.

## The Shard-Key Selection Rules

A good shard key:

1. **Appears in nearly every query's WHERE clause** — for shard-locality.
2. **Distributes data evenly** — high cardinality; no value dominates traffic.
3. **Is immutable for a row** — moving a row between shards is expensive.
4. **Has predictable growth** — won't shift hotspots over time.
5. **Matches the natural grain of operations** — common transactions are single-shard.

Common keys:
- **Multi-tenant SaaS**: `tenant_id`. Most queries are tenant-scoped; tenants are independent.
- **Per-user data**: `user_id`. Most queries are user-scoped.
- **Time-series**: `time_bucket(timestamp)`. Recent shards hot; older shards cold (often acceptable for time-series).
- **Geographic**: `region`. Latency benefit; regulatory benefit.

Bad keys:
- `created_at` (range hotspot at latest range).
- `status` (low cardinality; one value dominates).
- A column not in most query WHERE clauses (scatter-gather every query).

## Cross-Shard Query Trade-offs

| Operation | Single-shard | Cross-shard |
|---|---|---|
| Lookup by shard key | Fast | n/a (must include shard key) |
| Lookup not using shard key | Single-shard if data co-located | Scatter to every shard |
| JOIN | Fast within shard | Slow or unavailable |
| Aggregation | Fast | Scatter-gather; partial-aggregate-then-combine |
| Transaction | ACID via single-shard primary | Two-phase commit or distributed consensus; slow and failure-prone |

Schema design under sharding co-locates related data (store user's orders on user's shard) to make JOINs and transactions single-shard.

## When Sharding Is The Right Tool

| Workload property | Tool |
|---|---|
| Read load too high | Replication (read replicas) |
| Cache hit rate possible | Caching layer |
| Joins / aggregations slow | Denormalization, materialized views |
| Single-node CPU/memory exceeded | Vertical scaling |
| Storage approaching node limit | Sharding (or larger disks first) |
| Write throughput exceeds primary | Sharding |
| Geographic latency required | Sharding by region (with replication within region) |
| Multi-tenant isolation required | Sharding by tenant |

Sharding is the answer when write throughput or storage exceeds single-node capacity. Before that, simpler tools suffice.

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] Sharding is being considered after replication, caching, denormalization, and vertical scaling — not as a first response.
- [ ] The shard key is chosen against the criteria: appears in queries, distributes evenly, immutable, predictable, matches operation grain.
- [ ] Most production queries are single-shard. Scatter-gather queries are recognized as expensive and made rare.
- [ ] Related data is co-located on the same shard for JOIN and transaction locality.
- [ ] Cross-shard transactions are rare. Application design avoids them where possible.
- [ ] Resharding plan exists before launch: how shards are added, how data moves, what downtime is expected.
- [ ] Hot-shard detection is in place. Per-shard load metrics surface hotspots before they become incidents.
- [ ] Consistent hashing is used over modulo hash where resharding is anticipated. Naive hash modulo locks the shard count.
- [ ] The cross-shard query cost is documented and accepted. Reports and analytics that scatter-gather are run on read replicas or designed for the cost.
- [ ] Sharding interacts with replication intentionally — each shard's replication strategy is designed, not defaulted.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Copying the same data to multiple nodes | `replication-patterns` | replication copies; sharding partitions |
| The CAP / PACELC theoretical frame | `cap-theorem-tradeoffs` | CAP names the trade-off |
| Tuning a slow query | `query-optimization` | query-optimization is single-query |
| Designing indexes within a shard | `indexing-strategy` | indexing is within-node |
| Designing schema | `data-modeling` | data-modeling is the schema design; this is the partitioning of the schema |
| Single-node transactional behavior | `acid-fundamentals` | ACID is the single-system frame |
