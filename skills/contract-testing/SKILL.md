# Contract Testing

## Coverage

The technique of verifying interfaces between consumer and provider components by capturing the consumer's expectations as a contract artifact and running that contract against both sides independently. Covers the consumer-driven contracts pattern (Fowler 2006; Pact ecosystem), the two-phase verification (consumer-side mock generation; provider-side replay), the broker as the integration point that enables deploy independence and compatibility tracking, the contrast with schema-only validation (OpenAPI captures surface; contracts capture behavior), the contrast with integration and e2e testing (contracts verify the interface; integration and e2e verify implementation and journeys), and the tool ecosystem (Pact, Spring Cloud Contract, Specmatic, bi-directional patterns).

## Philosophy

Contract testing decouples deploy schedules between services. Before contract testing, two services that depended on each other had to be tested together — usually with brittle cross-service e2e tests in a shared staging environment, which serialized deploys and produced flaky signal. With contract testing, each side is verified independently against a shared contract; deploys can happen on independent schedules as long as the contract is satisfied.

The contract is *consumer-driven*: it captures what the consumer actually does, not what the provider offers. This narrowing — three endpoints out of fifty, twelve fields out of a hundred — is what makes contract testing focused and what distinguishes it from full schema validation. The provider can change anything the consumers don't rely on; the provider cannot break anything any consumer's contract requires.

The discipline is in the broker. A contract-test setup without a broker is "contracts as committed fixtures" — much of the maintenance cost, little of the deploy-independence benefit. A contract-test setup with a broker (Pact Broker, PactFlow) provides versioned contract storage, compatibility tracking, and deploy-gating; the strategic value of the technique is realized at this layer.

## The Two-Phase Verification

```
┌─────────────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Consumer's CI         │         │   Provider's CI         │
│                         │         │                         │
│ 1. Run consumer tests   │         │ 4. Fetch contracts      │
│    against generated    │         │    from broker          │
│    mock provider        │         │                         │
│                         │         │ 5. Replay each contract │
│ 2. If pass: contract    │         │    against real         │
│    is correct           │         │    provider             │
│                         │         │                         │
│ 3. Publish contract     │         │ 6. If pass: provider    │
│    to broker            │ ──────▶ │    satisfies contract   │
│                         │         │                         │
│                         │ ◀────── │ 7. Mark contract version│
│                         │  broker │    as verified          │
└─────────────────────────┘         └─────────────────────────┘
```

When both sides have passed independently, the broker records the compatibility. Deploy gating uses this record: don't deploy the provider unless its current version is marked compatible with the production consumer's contract.

## Schema vs Contract — A Practical Comparison

| Property | OpenAPI / JSON Schema | Consumer-driven contract |
|---|---|---|
| Captures | Surface (endpoints, types, shapes) | Behavior (specific interactions the consumer performs) |
| Driven by | Provider | Consumer |
| Coverage | Everything the provider offers | Only what consumers use |
| Catches breaking field value change | If schema constrains values; usually not | Yes — the contract has specific values |
| Catches semantic / error-shape change | No | Yes if consumer relies on the error |
| Verifies through real implementation | No (validates response against schema only) | Yes (provider runs the contract against itself) |
| Used for | API description, code generation, validation | Test gate between consumer and provider |
| Should you have both? | Yes | Yes |

## When Contract Testing Replaces What

| Pre-contract-testing approach | Contract-testing replacement | When replacement is right |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-service e2e test for service boundary | Contract test | Almost always — cheaper, more reliable, doesn't require both services running |
| Schema validation alone | Contract test + schema | Always — schema is necessary but not sufficient |
| Coordinated deploy schedules | Independent deploys + broker gating | Almost always — the deploy-independence is the strategic value |
| Manual API change reviews | Contract verification on provider CI | Always — the verification is automated |
| "We'll catch it in staging" | Contract test on PR | Always — catching at PR time is much cheaper |

## Broker-Enabled Deploy Gating

| State | Can deploy? |
|---|---|
| Provider version has been verified against current production consumer contract | Yes |
| Provider version has not yet been verified against current production consumer contract | No — run verification first |
| Provider version fails verification against production consumer contract | No — fix or coordinate with consumer |
| Consumer version's contract has not been verified against current production provider | No — run provider verification |

The broker's compatibility matrix is the deploy gate. Modern setups (PactFlow, Pact Broker `can-i-deploy` API) automate this; the deploy pipeline calls the broker and gets a yes/no answer.

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] Contracts are *consumer-driven* — written from consumer-side tests against real consumer code, not generated from provider specs.
- [ ] Contracts and OpenAPI/JSON-Schema coexist; the schema describes surface, the contract verifies behavior. Neither replaces the other.
- [ ] Both phases of verification run automatically: consumer-side on every consumer PR, provider-side on every provider PR (plus scheduled cron for drift detection).
- [ ] A broker is in use for any setup with more than 1-2 consumers per provider. The broker provides compatibility tracking and deploy gating.
- [ ] Deploy gating is wired: provider deploys are blocked if the version isn't verified against the production consumer's contract.
- [ ] Contract testing is *complementing* integration testing, not replacing it. The team still has integration tests for in-service behavior.
- [ ] Cross-service e2e tests have been reduced to the most-critical journeys; most cross-service e2e has migrated to contract tests.
- [ ] Message-bus and event-driven boundaries use contract testing where the consumer-provider pattern applies (Pact supports async message contracts).
- [ ] Contract evolution is handled: deprecating a field requires checking that no consumer's contract requires it; introducing a new field doesn't break existing contracts.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Testing the implementation behind a service interface | `integration-test-design` | integration tests verify in-service behavior; contracts verify the interface |
| Testing a user journey across the whole stack including UI | `e2e-test-design` | e2e tests verify the user experience; contracts verify the service boundary |
| Validating responses against an OpenAPI schema | OpenAPI/JSON-Schema validation tooling | schema validation captures surface; this skill captures behavior |
| Testing a single unit in isolation | `testing-strategy` + `test-doubles-design` | unit scope is below this skill's level |
| Designing the API surface itself | `api-design` | api-design owns the contract design; this skill owns the verification |
| Designing the event surface | `event-contract-design` | event-contract-design owns the asynchronous contract design; this skill verifies it |
| Choosing the test-level ratio | `testing-strategy` | strategy owns ratios; this skill owns the contract-testing technique |
