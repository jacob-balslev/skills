# Visual Design Foundations

## Coverage

Design and audit visual craft for interface surfaces. Covers palette direction, type scale, spacing rhythm, hierarchy, density, elevation, borders, contrast intent, visual weight, motion feel, brand fit, and when a visual system should be split into deeper color, typography, or motion skills.

## Philosophy

Visual design is not decoration after structure; it is how the structure becomes legible. Good visual craft makes priority, grouping, affordance, and tone visible without asking the user to parse every label.

Keep this skill at foundation level. If the task needs formal color math, font-loading engineering, or token governance, hand off to the skill that owns that contract.

## Method

1. Name the surface type: operational tool, docs, dashboard, editorial page, marketplace, or brand page.
2. State the intended tone and scanning demand.
3. Choose palette roles before picking raw colors: surface, text, accent, success, warning, danger, info, disabled.
4. Define type roles: page title, section heading, control label, body, metadata, numeric emphasis.
5. Set spacing and density rules that match repeated use, not one screenshot.
6. Use elevation, border, and background only to clarify grouping or affordance.
7. Check visual decisions against `semiotics` and `a11y` before treating them as done.

## Evals

This skill ships a comprehension-eval artifact at [`examples/evals/visual-design-foundations.json`](https://github.com/jacob-balslev/skill-graph/blob/main/examples/evals/visual-design-foundations.json). The checklist below is the authoring gate for visual-design decisions; the eval file is the grader surface.

## Verification

- [ ] Visual hierarchy makes primary content faster to find
- [ ] Palette roles are named by purpose rather than raw color
- [ ] Type roles are consistent and not oversized inside compact UI
- [ ] Spacing and density fit the surface's repeated-use context
- [ ] Elevation and borders clarify grouping instead of adding noise
- [ ] Motion, if used, clarifies state or continuity and can be reduced
- [ ] A11y contrast and non-color-only checks are deferred to `a11y`

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `semiotics` | The question is what a color, icon, badge, shape, or visual metaphor means. |
| `design-system-architecture` | The task is semantic tokens, component APIs, theming contracts, or governance. |
| `layout-composition` | The task is responsive structure, grid tracks, breakpoints, or section order. |
| `a11y` | The task is WCAG contrast, focus, labels, keyboard access, or assistive technology. |
| `microcopy` | The task is the wording inside buttons, dialogs, empty states, errors, or tooltips. |
