# Project Knowledge Extraction

## Coverage

Extract durable, reusable project knowledge from local evidence. Covers source discovery, fact extraction, vocabulary capture, decision mining, failure-pattern capture, artifact routing, grounding, freshness, and deciding whether knowledge belongs in a skill, ADR, context doc, glossary, runbook, or memory.

## Philosophy

Agents lose value when every session rediscovers the same project facts. The fix is not to dump everything into context. The fix is to extract durable knowledge, classify it, ground it in truth sources, and store it where future agents can find it.

Durable knowledge must be evidence-backed. If it cannot be tied to code, docs, decisions, or observed behavior, mark it as a hypothesis.

## Method

1. Inventory evidence: code surfaces, docs, issues, reports, tests, scripts, screenshots, and prior decisions.
2. Extract stable facts, recurring failure modes, vocabulary, boundaries, and source-of-truth files.
3. Discard session noise, one-off logs, and facts likely to expire quickly.
4. Classify destination: skill, ADR, context doc, glossary, runbook, memory, or no artifact.
5. Add grounding: truth sources, last-verified date, and drift trigger.
6. Link the new artifact into the context graph.
7. Verify by asking what future task this knowledge should improve.

## Verification

- [ ] Every retained fact has a truth source or is marked as a hypothesis
- [ ] One-off session notes were excluded
- [ ] Vocabulary distinctions are captured with examples
- [ ] Decisions are routed to ADRs, not buried in generic notes
- [ ] Reusable procedures are routed to skills or runbooks
- [ ] Artifact links make the knowledge discoverable later
- [ ] Drift triggers are clear for volatile facts

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `skill-scaffold` | You already know the skill to write and need the Skill Metadata Protocol contract. |
| `skill-infrastructure` | You need library tooling, audits, overlap detection, or health checks. |
| `documentation` | You need prose polish or a human-facing guide from known facts. |
| `skill-router` | You need to choose an existing skill for one prompt. |
