# Interaction Feedback

## Coverage

Design feedback states for user actions and system changes. Covers immediate click feedback, loading indicators, skeletons, optimistic UI, pending and disabled states, progress, success confirmation, persistent errors, retry, undo, autosave, long-running jobs, empty and low-data states, and perceived-latency staging.

## Philosophy

Feedback is the user's proof that the system heard them. Without it, users repeat actions, abandon flows, or assume data was lost. Good feedback is honest about uncertainty and gives recovery paths when the system cannot complete the action.

Feedback is not the same as performance. A fast system still needs confirmation, and a slow system still needs staged truth.

## Method

1. Name the action or state change that needs feedback.
2. Classify expected duration: instant, short, medium, long, background, or unknown.
3. Decide the feedback surface: inline state, button state, skeleton, banner, toast, progress row, modal, or job history.
4. Define transitions: idle, pending, partial, success, failure, retrying, cancelled, and undoable.
5. Preserve user control for long or destructive actions: cancel, retry, undo, leave-and-return.
6. Hand off wording to `microcopy` and announcement mechanics to `a11y`.
7. Verify the user can tell whether work is still happening, done, failed, or recoverable.

## Evals

This skill ships a comprehension-eval artifact at [`examples/evals/interaction-feedback.json`](https://github.com/jacob-balslev/skill-graph/blob/main/examples/evals/interaction-feedback.json). The checklist below is the authoring gate for feedback-state design; the eval file is the grader surface.

## Verification

- [ ] Every async action has an immediate observable response
- [ ] Long-running work has progress, backgrounding, or return-later behavior
- [ ] Optimistic updates define rollback and conflict behavior
- [ ] Success states are visible without being noisy
- [ ] Errors are persistent enough to recover from
- [ ] Retry, cancel, undo, or support paths exist when relevant
- [ ] Screen-reader announcement and wording are verified by `a11y` and `microcopy`

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `microcopy` | The task is writing button labels, toast text, empty-state text, or validation copy. |
| `a11y` | The task is live regions, screen-reader announcements, focus management, or WCAG compliance. |
| `state-machine-modeling` | The task is defining legal lifecycle states, guards, and transitions. |
| `performance-engineering` | The task is measuring and reducing latency, bundle size, query cost, or throughput. |
| `interaction-patterns` | The task is selecting the primary control or interaction pattern. |
