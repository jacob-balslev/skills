# State Machine Modeling

## Coverage

Define legal lifecycle behavior for a domain object, UI flow, job, integration, or process. Covers states, transitions, events, guards, side effects, terminal states, retries, timeouts, compensation, invalid states, and transition verification.

## Philosophy

State modeling prevents boolean sprawl. When a workflow has several flags that can combine into impossible conditions, the model is already a state machine - just an implicit and unsafe one.

Make illegal states unrepresentable where possible. Where that is not possible, make illegal transitions impossible and detectable.

## Method

1. Name the entity whose state is being modeled.
2. List observable states as nouns or adjectives, not events.
3. List events or commands that trigger transitions.
4. Add guards: conditions required before a transition is legal.
5. Add side effects separately from state changes.
6. Mark terminal, retryable, and compensating states.
7. Define invalid transitions and expected error behavior.
8. Create transition-table tests before implementation.

## Verification

- [ ] States are mutually exclusive unless explicitly modeled as parallel regions
- [ ] Every transition has a trigger
- [ ] Guards are explicit where transitions depend on conditions
- [ ] Side effects are not confused with state changes
- [ ] Terminal and retry states are named
- [ ] Invalid transitions have deterministic behavior
- [ ] Tests cover allowed and forbidden transitions

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `event-storming` | You need to discover the broader domain flow, commands, policies, and aggregates. |
| `data-modeling` | You need persistence schema or query shape for state data. |
| `observability-modeling` | The lifecycle is settled and you need metrics, logs, traces, or alerts. |
| `debugging` | A stateful system has already failed and needs root-cause analysis. |
