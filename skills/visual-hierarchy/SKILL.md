# Visual Hierarchy

## Coverage
Visual hierarchy is the ordering of perceptual prominence that tells a reader what to look at first, second, and third. The available signals are scale (larger draws attention before smaller), weight (heavier strokes draw attention before lighter), contrast (higher contrast against the background reads before lower), color (saturated and warm colors read before desaturated and cool), position (top-left in left-to-right reading cultures reads first; centered isolated elements break flow and draw focus), and isolation (whitespace around an element increases its prominence regardless of its intrinsic properties).

Type scale operationalizes scale as hierarchy. Modular scales — pairs of values related by a ratio (1.125 major second, 1.2 minor third, 1.25 major third, 1.333 perfect fourth, 1.414 augmented fourth, 1.5 perfect fifth, 1.618 golden ratio) — produce step sizes that feel intentional. The ratio chosen determines the perceptual distance between levels: a 1.125 ratio gives subtle hierarchy useful for content-dense interfaces; a 1.5 ratio gives loud hierarchy useful for marketing surfaces. Most production systems use 5–7 type sizes; more sizes dilute hierarchy by giving the reader too many similar steps.

Spacing creates hierarchy through proximity (Gestalt's law of proximity — items closer together read as grouped, items further apart read as separate) and through breathing room (an element with more whitespace around it reads as more important). Vertical rhythm — a consistent baseline grid that spacing values snap to — reinforces grouping without explicit dividers and makes the page feel calmer because the eye finds predictable resting points.

Contrast as ordering is more general than color contrast. Two equal-sized headlines can be ordered by weight (bold reads before regular), by color (filled black reads before mid-gray), or by treatment (underlined or boxed reads before plain). The principle: when two elements compete for attention, increase the difference along one dimension rather than incrementing many dimensions slightly. Loud-loud combinations exhaust the reader; one loud against many quiet directs them.

## Philosophy
Hierarchy is what you suppress, not what you amplify. Making one thing important by making everything else louder produces a flat, noisy surface where nothing is important. The discipline is restraint: most elements should be quiet so the few that need to be loud can be heard.

Reading order is a property of the page, not just the markup. CSS source order, visual size, color contrast, and position all participate. When they disagree — a giant pull quote in the middle of an article, an overlay button that contrasts more than the page title — the reader's eye follows the visual cues regardless of the writer's intent. Verify hierarchy by asking what someone notices first, second, and third without reading.

## Verification
- Squinting at the surface (or rendering it at low resolution) reveals an unambiguous order of attention; the intended first element is the first noticed.
- Type scale uses at most 7 sizes; each level differs from its neighbor enough to register as different at a glance.
- Whitespace around a primary element is larger than whitespace around its neighbors, not equal to them.
- A grayscale screenshot retains the intended hierarchy; if hierarchy collapses without color, the design is over-reliant on hue.
- Primary calls to action appear at most once per view; if two CTAs are present, one is visibly secondary in weight or fill.
- Adjacent elements at the same hierarchy level share scale, weight, and color treatment; deviations are deliberate and signal a meaningful difference.
- Reading the page aloud in the order the eye lands on elements matches the order intended by the content.

## Do NOT Use When
- The task is writing the copy itself rather than ordering it visually. Hierarchy without good copy emphasizes the wrong things.
- You are deciding how to structure a site's navigation or content taxonomy. That is information architecture, not visual hierarchy.
- The decision is which typeface to use or which color the brand should adopt. Use typography-system or color-system-design.
- The concern is grid structure, alignment, or column composition. Use layout-composition.
- The accessibility question is contrast ratios for WCAG compliance. Use a11y for the threshold; this skill for the design intent.
