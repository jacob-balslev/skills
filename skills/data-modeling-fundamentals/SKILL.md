# Data Modeling Fundamentals

## Coverage

The body of formal theory beneath practical database design. Covers Codd's relational model (1970), the closed relational algebra (selection, projection, join, union, difference, division), functional dependencies and the closure algorithm, the normal forms (1NF through 5NF, BCNF, with notes on 6NF and DKNF), Chen's entity-relationship model (1976) and its extensions, the principled framing of normalization vs denormalization as anomaly-elimination vs measured read-performance trade, the alternative data models (document, graph, key-value, columnar, time-series, event-sourced) characterized by which relational primitives they preserve or trade, and the foundational literature from Codd, Chen, Fagin, Date, Garcia-Molina, and Kleppmann that grounds modern database design.

## Philosophy

Data outlives application code. Application code is rewritten in years; stored data and integrations persist for decades. A bad data model is the most expensive kind of technical debt — every consumer (application, report, integration, analytical job) depends on it, and changing it requires coordinated migration across all of them. The discipline of getting the model right early pays back over the data's full lifetime.

Without the theory, design becomes folklore. Teams normalize because someone said normalization is good; they denormalize because someone said joins are slow. Neither claim is wrong, but without the theory underneath, the decisions are tribal rather than reasoned. The theoretical layer — what normal forms guarantee, what anomalies each form eliminates, what relational algebra closure buys — makes the conversation precise.

Normalization is a principled cleanup procedure, not an aesthetic standard. Each normal form eliminates a specific class of anomaly; the question is not "what normal form is this in" but "are the anomalies this form admits operationally relevant to our workload." The discipline is matching the form to the workload.

## The Normal Forms — A Sequence of Anomaly Eliminations

| Form | Eliminates | Defined by |
|---|---|---|
| 1NF | Repeating groups, non-atomic attributes | Atomic values only |
| 2NF | Partial-key dependencies | 1NF + every non-key attribute fully depends on the whole key |
| 3NF | Transitive non-prime dependencies | 2NF + no non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute |
| BCNF | Anomalies in overlapping candidate keys | Every non-trivial FD has a superkey on its left |
| 4NF | Multi-valued-dependency anomalies | BCNF + no non-trivial multi-valued dependencies |
| 5NF | Join-dependency anomalies | 4NF + every join dependency is implied by candidate keys |

**The discipline:** start with FDs, derive closure, find candidate keys, test normal-form membership, decompose to the level where the anomalies that matter for the workload are eliminated.

## The Relational Algebra — Why It Composes

| Operator | Notation | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Selection | σ_predicate(R) | Filter rows |
| Projection | π_columns(R) | Filter columns |
| Join | R ⋈ S | Combine relations on matching attributes |
| Union | R ∪ S | Set union of compatible relations |
| Difference | R − S | Set difference |
| Intersection | R ∩ S | Set intersection (derivable) |
| Division | R ÷ S | Tuples in R matching all values in S |
| Rename | ρ_a→b(R) | Rename attributes |

Every operator's input and output are relations. This *closure* is what makes the algebra compose — JOIN of JOIN of JOIN is still a relation, queryable by further algebra. SQL inherits this property; the document, graph, and key-value alternatives give it up in exchange for different access patterns.

## Normalization vs Denormalization — The Principled Tradeoff

| Path | Benefit | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Normalize to BCNF | No update, insert, delete anomalies | More tables, more joins, slower reads |
| Denormalize selectively | Faster reads for measured access patterns | Update anomalies application must manage |
| Materialized view | Pre-computed aggregations | Refresh complexity; staleness window |
| Embedded reference (document-style) | Read locality | Update fan-out across embedded copies |
| Pre-computed aggregate | O(1) reads of sums/counts | Write-time computation; consistency burden |

**Principled framing:** normalize to eliminate operationally-relevant anomalies; denormalize specific paths for measured read-performance need; accept the consistency burden explicitly.

## Alternative Models — What They Trade

| Model | Preserves | Trades away | Wins for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Document (MongoDB) | Per-document atomicity | Cross-document joins, transactional consistency | Aggregate-as-document reads |
| Graph (Neo4j) | Relationship traversal | Tabular query, aggregation | Many-hop relationship queries |
| Key-value (Redis) | Point access | Structured query | Caching, simple lookups |
| Wide-column (Cassandra) | Distributed scale | Joins, ACID transactions | Distributed writes, time-series |
| Columnar (BigQuery, ClickHouse) | Analytical aggregation | Point access, transactional updates | OLAP workloads |
| Time-series (TimescaleDB, InfluxDB) | Timestamp-indexed writes | Generic relational query | Metrics, IoT, observability |
| Event-sourced | Full history | Current-state read complexity, storage | Audit, financial ledger |

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] The functional dependencies of the schema have been listed explicitly. Normalization claims are grounded in FDs, not in intuition.
- [ ] The normal form chosen for each table matches the workload's anomaly tolerance. Higher form is not asserted as "better" without justification.
- [ ] Denormalization decisions have a measured read-performance justification and a documented plan for maintaining the redundant data consistently. Denormalization-by-reflex is not present.
- [ ] The choice of data model (relational vs document vs graph vs columnar vs event-sourced) has been justified against the workload's dominant access pattern, not chosen by tribal preference.
- [ ] Integrity constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, NOT NULL, CHECK constraints, UNIQUE indexes) are present where the theory requires them. Entity integrity and referential integrity are enforced at the database layer, not delegated to the application.
- [ ] The ER model (entities, relationships, cardinality) was drawn before tables were designed. The schema reflects entity structure, not query-shape.
- [ ] For each non-relational model in use, the team can name what relational primitive is being traded and what the application is doing in exchange. The choice is principled, not unexamined.
- [ ] Anti-patterns are recognized: EAV (entity-attribute-value) tables for arbitrary metadata, JSON columns used to avoid schema design, missing foreign keys, denormalization without consistency strategy.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Designing the practical schema for a new persistence layer | `data-modeling` | data-modeling owns the method; this owns the theory |
| Applying a migration to an existing schema | `schema-evolution` | schema-evolution owns the migration mechanics |
| Choosing which indexes to maintain | `indexing-strategy` | indexing-strategy owns the index design surface |
| Discovering business entities without implementation details | `conceptual-modeling` | conceptual-modeling sits above this layer at the business-domain level |
| Drawing an ER diagram for a specific design | `entity-relationship-modeling` | entity-relationship-modeling owns the ER notation and discovery method |
| Tuning a slow query against the current schema | `query-optimization` | query-optimization owns runtime performance |
