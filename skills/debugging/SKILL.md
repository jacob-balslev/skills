# Debugging

## Coverage

- Reproduction: turning a vague bug report into a deterministic failing case
- Scope reduction: isolating the smallest surface where the failure still reproduces
- Evidence capture: collecting logs, stack traces, and state snapshots at the moment of failure
- Root-cause isolation: distinguishing symptoms from causes and resisting the urge to patch symptoms
- Fix verification: re-running the original failure path to confirm the fix is real
- Regression prevention: converting the failing case into a permanent test so the same bug cannot return silently

## Philosophy

The fastest way to fix a bug is usually the wrong fix. A working reproduction is worth more than a plausible hypothesis; a plausible hypothesis is worth more than a clever fix; a clever fix that skips the reproduction step ships the same bug again under a different name. When pressure is high the temptation to jump from symptom to patch is also high — resist it, because the cost of a wrong fix is paid again by the next person who hits the same failure with less context than you had.

## Workflow

Each step asks a question. The answer decides the next step. Do not skip steps to save time; the steps exist because skipping them is how bugs return.

| Step | Ask | If yes | If no |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Reproduce | Do you have a deterministic failing case? | Go to step 2 | Add logging, narrow inputs, or run the failing path in a loop until the failure is reliable |
| 2. Scope | Can you reproduce it in a surface smaller than the full system? | Go to step 3 | Bisect — halve the code path, data, or config and retry |
| 3. Evidence | Do you have the state at the moment of failure, not just the symptom after? | Go to step 4 | Add instrumentation at the boundary where state flips wrong |
| 4. Cause | Does your hypothesis explain ALL of the evidence, not just the visible symptom? | Go to step 5 | Form a better hypothesis — partial explanations hide shared root causes |
| 5. Verify | Does the same evidence path pass with the fix applied, and fail with it reverted? | Go to step 6 | The fix did not land or the cause was wrong — return to step 4 |
| 6. Regression test | Does the test you just wrote fail without the fix and pass with it? | Done | Your test is not isolating the cause — rewrite it |

### When to stop and escalate

- Step 1 is still unreproducible after ~60 min of narrowing → suspect non-determinism (race, timing, clock, network). This is a design issue, not a debugging issue.
- Step 3 instrumentation shows contradictory state on the same object → suspect memory corruption, concurrent mutation, or stale cache. Out of scope for a single-file debugger; escalate to architectural review.
- The same bug returned after a previous fix → the previous fix patched a symptom. Start over at step 1 and find the real cause.

## Evals

This skill ships a comprehension-eval artifact at [`examples/evals/debugging.json`](https://github.com/jacob-balslev/skill-graph/blob/main/examples/evals/debugging.json). The `Verification` checklist below is the authoring gate for a completed debugging pass; the eval file is how this skill is graded by `scripts/skill-audit.js --graded`. Do not conflate them — the checklist is for the debugger, the eval is for the grader.

## Verification

- [ ] The original failure was reproduced deterministically, not just described
- [ ] The hypothesis explains every piece of evidence collected, not a subset
- [ ] The fix was verified by the same evidence path that revealed the bug
- [ ] A regression test fails without the fix and passes with it
- [ ] The next engineer who hits this failure can reach the fix from the regression test alone

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `refactor` | The task is structural cleanup, not failure-driven diagnosis |
| `testing-strategy` | The task is planning what to test, not chasing a known failure |
| `documentation` | The task is explaining behavior, not fixing broken behavior |
