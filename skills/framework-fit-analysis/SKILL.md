# Framework Fit Analysis

## Coverage

Evaluate technology fit before adoption, replacement, or standardization. Covers requirement fit, constraints, ecosystem maturity, maintenance health, team skill, integration cost, migration path, performance envelope, security posture, operational burden, lock-in, exit cost, and decision recording.

## Philosophy

Technology choice is context-dependent. "Best" without constraints is marketing. A good fit analysis makes tradeoffs explicit enough that a team can accept the costs knowingly.

Do not confuse popularity with fit. Do not let a narrow implementation preference choose a durable platform. The right output is a recommendation plus consequences, not a ranking table with fake precision.

## Method

1. State the job the technology must do.
2. List hard constraints: runtime, hosting, data, compliance, team, budget, timeline.
3. Define evaluation criteria and weights qualitatively: must-have, important, nice-to-have.
4. Compare credible options, including staying put.
5. Assess migration and exit costs.
6. Identify operational ownership and failure modes.
7. Recommend one path with accepted tradeoffs.
8. Hand off to `architecture-decision-records` if the decision is durable.

## Evals

This skill ships a comprehension-eval artifact at [`examples/evals/framework-fit-analysis.json`](https://github.com/jacob-balslev/skill-graph/blob/main/examples/evals/framework-fit-analysis.json). The checklist below is the authoring gate for technology-fit decisions; the eval file is the grader surface.

## Verification

- [ ] The recommendation is tied to explicit project constraints
- [ ] "Do nothing" or "keep current stack" was considered when real
- [ ] Migration and exit costs are named
- [ ] Operational ownership is named
- [ ] Performance and security claims are evidence-backed or marked uncertain
- [ ] The decision can be reversed only with known cost
- [ ] Follow-up ADR is proposed for durable choices

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `dependency-architecture` | You need dependency graph hygiene, package boundaries, duplication control, or supply-chain guardrails. |
| `architecture-decision-records` | The choice is already made and needs a record. |
| `performance-engineering` | You need to measure and optimize actual runtime behavior. |
| A framework-specific skill | The framework is already chosen and the task is implementation. |
