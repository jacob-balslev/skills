# Connection Pooling

## Coverage

The discipline of managing a finite set of database connections shared across many application threads, requests, or processes. Covers the connection cost (server-side process/thread, memory, locks), why pooling is required (open-cost amortization, throughput cap, load-shedding), application-level vs proxy-level pools, the three PgBouncer modes (session, transaction, statement) and their feature compatibility, the canonical pool-sizing math via Little's Law and HikariCP's analyses, the failure modes catalog (connection exhaustion, idle-in-transaction, hot-loop reconnect, prepared-statement breakage, cross-connection state leaks, long-tail accumulation), the operational concerns (wait-time monitoring, connection rotation, reconnect backoff, health checks), and the database-specific connection models (Postgres process-per-connection, MySQL thread-per-connection, serverless variants).

## Philosophy

The pool is a throughput throttle, not a resource budget. Sizing too large doesn't make slow queries faster — it makes the database thrash and shifts the symptom from "queue waiting for connection" to "queue waiting for CPU, buffer cache, or locks." Sizing too small produces queue waits. The right size is the smallest pool that doesn't queue under peak load — typically much smaller than teams initially set.

Pooling mode determines feature surface. The choice between session, transaction, and statement pooling is not just operational — it determines what features the application is allowed to use at the database. Transaction pooling buys multiplexing in exchange for session-feature loss; statement pooling buys further multiplexing in exchange for transaction loss. Knowing which features the application uses, and the cross-product against the pooling mode, is preconditional to choosing a mode.

The pool is the place where database-level health becomes application-level latency. A workload contending on the pool surfaces as request queueing in the application, not as slow queries in the database log. Pool instrumentation (`pool.active`, `pool.idle`, `pool.waiting`, `pool.acquire_time`) is the operational hygiene that makes contention legible.

## Sizing — Little's Law in Practice

**Little's Law:** concurrency = arrival rate × average service time.

| Workload | Arrival rate | Avg query time | Concurrency | Pool size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OLTP point query | 10,000 req/sec | 1 ms | 10 | 12–15 |
| OLTP transaction | 1,000 req/sec | 10 ms | 10 | 12–15 |
| Mixed read/write | 2,000 req/sec | 25 ms | 50 | 60–80 |
| Analytical | 100 req/sec | 500 ms | 50 | Pool partitioning recommended |

The pool size is *peak concurrency + small headroom*. Teams that size by request rate (treating pool size as a per-app-server quota) over-size by 10x or more, then discover the database is thrashing.

**HikariCP's documented advice:** start with `cores * 2 + effective_spindle_count` (e.g., 8 cores → pool size 18); raise only when measured queue waits prove a larger pool helps. Most OLTP pools are <20 per app instance.

## PgBouncer Mode Matrix

| Feature | Session | Transaction | Statement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prepared statements (server-side) | ✅ | ✅ (1.21+) / ❌ (pre-1.21) | ❌ |
| `SET` session variables | ✅ | ❌ (use `SET LOCAL`) | ❌ |
| `SET LOCAL` (transaction-scoped) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Advisory locks | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `WITH HOLD` cursors | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Temporary tables across transactions | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Transactions | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Multiplexing benefit | 1x | High (10–100x) | Highest |

**Default rule:** Transaction mode for production scale; verify the application uses no session-spanning features (or, if it does, audit each one). Session mode when full Postgres feature surface is required.

## The Failure Modes Catalog

| Symptom | Likely cause | First diagnostic |
|---|---|---|
| `too many connections` error | Pool size × instances > `max_connections`; reconnect storm | Sum app pools + replica pools; check reconnect rate |
| Request latency spike, query latency normal | Pool exhaustion (queries holding connections too long) | `pool.acquire_time_p99` vs query latency |
| Intermittent "prepared statement does not exist" | PgBouncer transaction mode, pre-1.21 | Upgrade PgBouncer or disable server-side prepares |
| Random session-variable values | `SET` (not `SET LOCAL`) under transaction pooling | Audit `SET` use; switch to `SET LOCAL` |
| Connections held for hours; transaction-id age growing | Idle-in-transaction | `pg_stat_activity` for long `idle in transaction` |
| Brief outage during deploy | Reconnect storm | Stagger app startup; add reconnect backoff |
| Slow degradation over weeks | Long-tail connection age (memory bloat, stale prepared statements) | Enable `maxLifetime` rotation |

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:
- [ ] Pool size has been calculated against Little's Law for the workload — not copied from advice columns. Peak concurrency × small headroom, not request rate.
- [ ] Sum of (app pool size × app instances) + replica pools + admin connections fits inside the database's `max_connections` with headroom. The database-side total is bounded, not just the per-instance pool.
- [ ] If PgBouncer transaction mode is enabled, the application's use of prepared statements, `SET`, advisory locks, `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, and WITH HOLD cursors has been audited. Compatible patterns confirmed; incompatible patterns refactored.
- [ ] Pool instrumentation is in place: `pool.acquire_time`, `pool.active`, `pool.waiting`. Connection contention shows up as a first-class signal, not as opaque application latency.
- [ ] `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` is set (Postgres) so leaked transactions don't hold pool slots indefinitely. Application code does not perform external service calls inside database transactions.
- [ ] Connection rotation (`maxLifetime` / `server_lifetime`) is configured so connections refresh and don't accumulate long-tail bloat.
- [ ] Reconnect backoff and circuit-breaking are configured so deploy churn or brief network partitions don't produce reconnect storms.
- [ ] If serverless or auto-scaled application instances are used, a proxy pool (PgBouncer, Supavisor, RDS Proxy) caps the database-side connection total. Client count and server connection count are decoupled.
- [ ] Long-running queries (>1s) and short-running queries are not in the same pool. Pool partitioning prevents one class from starving the other.

## Do NOT Use When

| Instead of this skill | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Tuning a slow query | `query-optimization` | query-optimization owns query-level cost; this owns connection-level cost |
| Designing indexes | `indexing-strategy` | indexing-strategy owns access-path design |
| Routing reads vs writes across replicas | `replication-patterns` | replication-patterns owns the routing layer above pooling |
| Partitioning data across shards | `sharding-strategy` | sharding-strategy owns the data-partition layer; pooling sits beneath it per shard |
| Choosing transaction isolation level | `transaction-isolation` | isolation owns the per-transaction concurrency contract |
| Designing the schema | `data-modeling` | data-modeling owns design; pooling is operational |
