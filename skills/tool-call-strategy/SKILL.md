# Tool Call Strategy

## Coverage

- The three costs of every tool call: token cost (schema overhead and result size), latency cost (round-trip and decision time), context pollution (results persist in attention window)
- The script-vs-call decision gate: deterministic bulk work belongs in a script; reasoning-dependent work belongs in individual tool calls with the agent in the loop
- Tool selection decision tree: file-search vs content-search vs targeted-read vs full-read, harness-native structured tools vs shell fallback, and the harness-agnostic capability map
- Batching independent calls in a single message vs sequential round-trips, and the dependency-detection heuristic
- Redundancy avoidance: the conversation-as-cache mental model, recognising re-reads, re-searches, and re-runs
- Context-efficient patterns: targeted line ranges, bounded verification output, dedicated-tool defaults, provenance notes, and tool-result lifecycle
- Subagent delegation for context protection: when exploration belongs in a disposable subagent context vs the main session
- The poka-yoke principle: design tool usage to prevent mistakes, not just optimise speed
- Cost benchmark heuristics: rough call-count ranges per task type and the "stop and reconsider" red flag

## Philosophy

Every tool call has three simultaneous costs: tokens (schema overhead plus result), latency (network round-trip plus decision time), and context pollution (results persist in the attention window and degrade subsequent reasoning). Agents that issue 12 calls where 3 would suffice are not merely slower — they are measurably less accurate, because noise accumulated in the context window pushes useful signal further from the attention window.

The optimal strategy is not "minimise calls." Under-calling causes hallucination and skipped verification. The objective is **information gained per unit cost**: a single well-targeted grep that returns five matching lines is worth more than reading three entire files to find the same information. A script that processes fifty files in one shell call is worth more than fifty individual edit calls. The conversation history acts as a cache; information already retrieved does not need to be retrieved again.

> A tool call is like a SQL query against a slow, expensive, noisy database — plan it before you run it, do not re-run queries whose results are already in the result set, and reach for set-based operations (scripts) when you catch yourself doing the same row-level work N times.

## The Three Costs of Every Tool Call

| Cost | Mechanism | Magnitude |
|---|---|---|
| **Token cost** | Tool schemas sent with every request (~500 tokens per declared tool). Each result adds to conversation. Ten available tools = ~5,000 tokens of overhead before any user input. | Scales with number of available tools and result size |
| **Latency cost** | Network round-trip, tool execution time, model decision time per call | ~200–2000 ms per call; compounds for sequential calls |
| **Context pollution** | Every result stays in conversation history. Failed attempts, verbose outputs, and redundant reads all persist | Degrades reasoning quality as context fills |

**The compound effect:** five unnecessary reads do not just cost five times the tokens — they push useful context further from the attention window, degrading the quality of subsequent reasoning. Context is not just a budget; it is a signal-to-noise ratio.

## Source Notes

This skill treats vendor tool protocols as evidence for the strategy, not as its whole scope. OpenAI's function-calling guide frames tool calling as a multi-step conversation where the application supplies tools, executes requested calls, and returns outputs for the next model turn; it also notes that large tool surfaces consume context and can be narrowed with mechanisms such as tool search or allowed-tool subsets. Anthropic's tool-use docs describe the same model/runtime separation and document parallel tool use for independent work plus context-management patterns for keeping tool output from overwhelming the conversation. Those protocol facts support the portable strategy here: plan calls, keep independent work parallel, keep dependent work sequential, and shape tool outputs as first-class context.

## Harness-Agnostic Tool Capability Map

Every modern coding-agent harness exposes the same five abstract tool capabilities under different concrete names. Substitute your harness's equivalents when applying this skill.

| Abstract capability | Claude Code | Cursor / Copilot / Continue | OpenCode | Shell-only fallback |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| File-pattern search (find files by name/path glob) | `Glob` | `file_search` | `glob` | `rg --files`, then `find` |
| Content search (find text inside files) | `Grep` | `grep_search` | `grep` | `rg`, then `grep -r` |
| Targeted read (read specific lines of a file) | `Read` (with `offset`/`limit`) | `read_file` (with line range) | `read` | `sed -n 'A,Bp'` |
| Diff-based edit (modify part of a file) | `Edit` / `MultiEdit` | `replace_string_in_file` / `apply_patch` | `edit` | `sed -i` (avoid) |
| Shell execution (run an arbitrary command) | `Bash` | `run_in_terminal` | `bash` | direct shell |

The principles in this skill apply uniformly across all of them. Examples below use the Cursor/Copilot names because they are the most descriptive; the same advice applies to whichever set of names your harness exposes.

## The Script-vs-Call Decision Gate

The single most impactful optimisation: use scripts for deterministic work, tool calls for reasoning-dependent work.

```
Is the operation deterministic (known input → known output)?
  YES → Can it be expressed as a shell command or script?
          YES → Write a script, run once via a shell-execution tool
          NO  → Single tool call with structured output
  NO  → Does the operation require reasoning about intermediate results?
          YES → Individual tool calls with the agent in the loop
          NO  → Batch into a script that returns structured data the agent can reason about
```

### When scripts beat tool calls

| Scenario | Tool-call approach | Script approach | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rename a variable across 20 files | 20 diff-based edit calls | One project-owned script via shell execution | 19 fewer calls |
| Check which files import a module | 10 targeted-read calls | One content-search call | 9 fewer calls |
| Run lint + typecheck + test | 3 sequential shell calls | `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` | 2 fewer calls |
| Create 5 similar test files | 5 file-creation calls | Script that generates all 5 | 4 fewer calls |
| Collect metrics from multiple sources | N targeted-read calls | Script that aggregates and returns JSON | N−1 fewer calls |

### When tool calls beat scripts

| Scenario | Why a script fails |
|---|---|
| Edit depends on understanding the code around it | The agent needs to read, reason, then decide what to change |
| Search result determines next action | The search path cannot be predicted in advance |
| Error in one step changes the approach for the next | Scripts cannot reason about failures mid-flight |
| Output needs human or agent review before proceeding | Scripts execute blindly |

## Tool Selection Decision Tree

Choose the right tool for the information need. Wrong tool choice is the largest single source of wasted calls.

```
Need to find files by name or path pattern?
  → file-pattern search; if shell is the available search surface, use `rg --files` before `find`

Need to find content inside files?
  → Need the matching lines themselves?
        YES → content search with matching lines (returns content)
        NO  → Just need file paths? content search or file-pattern search

Need to read file contents?
  → Know which lines you need?
        YES → targeted read with line range
        NO  → Need the whole file?
                YES → full read (default)
                NO  → content search for the specific function or class first, then targeted read of the section

Need to modify a file?
  → Targeted change to existing content?
        YES → diff-based edit (sends only the diff; fails if the old string does not match)
        NO  → Complete rewrite or new file?
                YES → file-creation tool
                NO  → diff-based edit

Need to run a command?
  → Is there a structured harness tool for this? (read tool, content search, file-pattern search)
        YES → use the structured tool
        NO  → shell execution
```

### Critical rules

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| Prefer structured read/search tools when the harness provides them | They usually return line numbers, respect workspace permissions, and keep output easier to inspect |
| In shell-first harnesses, prefer `rg` and `rg --files` before `grep -r`, `find`, or `ls` | Ripgrep is faster, has better defaults for code search, and makes it easier to narrow output |
| Use `head`, `tail`, or line-range reads to bound output, not as a blind substitute for targeted search | Output shaping protects context; blind file dumping pollutes it |
| Never default to inline `sed` or `awk` edits in shell | Prefer diff-based edits for reviewable changes; reserve raw `sed` for cases where a script would be disproportionate |
| Content search before full read | Content search returns only matching lines; full read returns the entire file |
| File-pattern search before content search | If you know the file pattern, narrow the search space first |

## Batching and Parallelization

### Independent calls: batch in a single message

If two or more tool calls do not depend on each other's output, make them all in the same message.

**Sequential (bad):**
```
Message 1: read file A         → wait for result
Message 2: read file B         → wait for result
Message 3: search for pattern  → wait for result
Total: 3 round-trips
```

**Parallel (good):**
```
Message 1: read file A + read file B + search for pattern
Total: 1 round-trip (wall-clock = max of individual calls)
```

### Dependency detection

| Calls are independent when | Calls are dependent when |
|---|---|
| Different files, no shared state | Second call uses first call's output |
| Read-only operations | First call creates or modifies what second reads |
| Verification checks (lint, type, test) | Error in first determines whether to run second |

### Batching heuristic

Before making a tool call, ask: *"Is there another call I need to make that does not depend on this one's result?"* If yes, batch them.

## Avoiding Redundant Operations

### The information-cache mental model

Treat the conversation context as a cache. Information already retrieved does not need to be retrieved again.

| Redundancy type | Example | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Re-reading a file | Read file A, make an edit, re-read file A to verify | The edit tool confirms what changed; trust it |
| Re-searching for the same pattern | Two identical content searches in one conversation | Reference the earlier result |
| Reading a file just written | Create file, then read it to confirm contents | File creation confirms success; trust it |
| Running the same verification twice | `pnpm typecheck` after edit, then again before commit | Once is enough if no other changes were made |
| Exploring broadly then narrowly | Search all files, then search the same pattern in a subdirectory | Start narrow; widen only if needed |

### The "Do I already know this?" check

Before every tool call, answer: *"Is this information already in my context from a previous call?"* If yes, reference it instead of re-fetching.

## Context-Efficient Patterns

### For file reading

| Need | Efficient pattern | Wasteful pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Find a specific function | Content search for the function name, then targeted read of the 30-line section | Full read of the entire 2000-line file |
| Check if a pattern exists | Content search (returns match count) | Full read of the entire file and search manually |
| Read multiple small sections | Multiple targeted reads with explicit line ranges | One full read that includes irrelevant code |
| Compare two files | Targeted reads of both with relevant line ranges | Full reads of both |

### For file modification

| Need | Efficient pattern | Wasteful pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Change one line | Diff-based edit with minimal old/new string | Full file rewrite |
| Change N similar lines | Diff-based edits batched in one message | N separate sequential edit calls |
| Change across many files | Project-owned script (Node, Python) — see note below | N separate edit calls |
| Create a new file | File-creation tool | Diff-based edit (cannot edit what does not exist) |

> **Bulk-edit note:** for "change across many files", prefer a project-owned script (Node, Python) that produces a reviewable diff rather than inline `sed -i` or `awk` in a shell call. Inline `sed -i` bypasses agent review and is hard to audit. Reserve raw `sed` for cases where a proper script would be disproportionate overhead.

### For verification

| Need | Efficient pattern | Wasteful pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Check if tests pass | `pnpm test 2>&1 \| tail -20` | Full unbounded test output in context |
| Check if a server is running | `curl -sf URL > /dev/null && echo up \|\| echo down` | Full curl output with headers and body |
| Check types | `pnpm typecheck 2>&1 \| head -30` | Unbounded typecheck output |
| Run multiple checks | `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` (one call) | Three separate shell calls |

### For tool-result lifecycle

| Need | Efficient pattern | Wasteful pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Preserve evidence | Summarise the result with file paths, line numbers, command names, and pass/fail status | Keep a full raw transcript in the main context after the useful facts have been extracted |
| Retry after failure | Change one variable before retrying and record what changed | Re-run the identical failing call hoping for a different result |
| Continue after broad exploration | Compact to the decision, evidence path, and open questions | Carry every exploratory hit forward as if it were still active context |
| Hand off to a user or reviewer | Report the smallest reproducible command and the decisive lines | Paste unbounded logs with no interpretation |

## Subagent Delegation for Context Protection

Subagents run in separate contexts. Use them to prevent context pollution from exploratory work.

### When to use subagents

| Scenario | Why subagent |
|---|---|
| Exploring an unfamiliar part of the codebase | Exploration reads many files; main context stays clean |
| Running a broad search that may return many results | Results stay in subagent context; only the summary returns |
| Reviewing code (writer/reviewer pattern) | Reviewer has fresh context without implementation bias |
| Parallel independent investigations | Each runs in its own context without cross-contamination |

### When NOT to use subagents

| Scenario | Why direct |
|---|---|
| Single targeted read or content search | Subagent overhead exceeds the call itself |
| Work that requires multiple back-and-forth decisions | Subagent cannot ask clarifying questions mid-task |
| Simple file edits | Direct is faster |

### Subagent context-efficiency rule

Brief subagents with the minimum context they need. Include: what to find, where to look, what format to report back in. Do not include: full conversation history, unrelated background, or "figure out what I need."

## The Poka-Yoke Principle

Design tool usage to prevent mistakes, not just optimise speed. *Poka-yoke* (Japanese: "mistake-proofing") is the lean-manufacturing principle of designing the work so the wrong action is hard or impossible.

| Poka-yoke | Why it prevents errors |
|---|---|
| Use absolute file paths | Relative paths break when working directory changes |
| Prefer diff-based edit over full-file rewrite for existing files | Diff-based edit fails if the old string does not match; full rewrite silently overwrites |
| Run a content search before a full read | Confirms the file exists and contains the pattern before reading the full content |
| Run verification *after* edits, not before | Pre-edit verification is wasted if the edit changes the result |
| Pipe long outputs through `tail` or `head` | Prevents context overflow from verbose commands |

## Cost Benchmark Heuristics

Rough guideline ranges for different task types. These are heuristic targets, not empirically calibrated thresholds — actual counts vary by task complexity, codebase familiarity, and how much context is already in the session. Treat them as "should I stop and reconsider?" thresholds, not hard limits.

| Task type | Guideline range | Typical tools |
|---|---|---|
| Simple bug fix (1 file) | 3–5 calls | Content search, targeted read, diff-based edit, verify |
| Feature addition (2–3 files) | 5–10 calls | Read existing patterns, write new code, verify |
| Refactor (many files) | 3–8 calls | Content search to find all sites, script to batch-edit, verify |
| Investigation / exploration | 5–15 calls | Multiple content searches and targeted reads |
| Complex multi-file feature | 10–20 calls | Plan, read patterns, implement, verify |

**Red flag:** if a task is taking more than 20 tool calls, stop and ask: *"Am I using the right approach?"* Consider scripting, subagent delegation, or a different strategy. The fact that 20 calls feels like a lot is itself a useful signal — listen to it.

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:

- [ ] Content search ran before targeted read when looking for specific content
- [ ] Independent tool calls were batched in the same message
- [ ] Scripts replaced N+1 individual calls for deterministic bulk operations
- [ ] No re-reads or re-searches for information already in context
- [ ] Targeted reads with explicit line ranges were used for large files
- [ ] Verbose command outputs were piped through `head` or `tail`
- [ ] Tool results were summarised into durable evidence and raw verbose output was not carried forward unnecessarily
- [ ] Shell fallback used fast, narrow search/read commands when structured harness tools were unavailable
- [ ] Total tool calls fall within the benchmark range for this task type, or there is a documented reason they exceed it
- [ ] Subagents were used for context-heavy exploration, not for trivial single calls

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| `prompt-craft` | The fix is in the wording of one instruction (clarity, format, few-shot examples), not how the surrounding tool calls are sequenced |
| `context-engineering` | The question is about the entire information stack (system prompt, memory, rules, skills) reaching the model, not per-call efficiency |
| `debugging` | A tool is returning errors at runtime — that is a bug, not an efficiency problem |
| `refactor` | The deliverable is a behaviour-preserving code transformation; the tool-call efficiency of getting there is a means, not the end |
| `skill-router` | Deciding which *skill* should activate for a query, not which *tool call* the activated skill should make next |
| `documentation` | Writing prose for a human reader explaining how the agent's tool usage works |
