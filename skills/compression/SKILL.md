# Compression

## Domain Context

**What is this skill?** This skill provides expertise in data and context compression: SaaS payload optimization (Zstd, Brotli, Gzip), database storage compression, and AI context window compression (Semantic Summarization, Token Pruning). Use when optimizing API latency, reducing storage costs, or managing long-running agent sessions near context limits. Do NOT use for image/video lossy compression (use product-photo) or file archiving.

## Coverage

SaaS payload compression (Zstd, Brotli, Gzip algorithm selection, level tuning, content negotiation), PostgreSQL storage compression (TOAST with Zstd, application-layer blob compression), and AI context window compression (semantic summarization, token pruning, dead context identification, state re-injection). Covers the decision tree for matching algorithms to data types, the `Accept-Encoding` negotiation order, and the three-phase token pruning workflow.

## Philosophy

Compression is the science of increasing information density. In a modern SaaS, it applies at two layers: the **Infrastructure Layer** (reducing bytes on the wire/disk) and the **Intelligence Layer** (reducing tokens in the context window). Without this skill, agents default to generic compression advice that ignores the specific algorithm-to-data-type mapping (e.g., using Gzip everywhere instead of Zstd for dynamic API payloads) and fail to recognize that sub-1KB payloads should skip compression entirely. On the intelligence side, agents routinely let context windows bloat with dead research turns instead of applying structured summarization that preserves evidence paths.

## 1. SaaS Data Compression Decision Tree

Match the compression algorithm to the data type and lifecycle.

| Data Type                  | Recommended              | Why?                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Static Assets** (JS/CSS) | Brotli (Level 11)        | Highest ratio for web strings; slow build-time OK.         |
| **Dynamic API** (JSON)     | Zstd (Level 3)           | Fastest decompression; lower TTFB than Gzip.               |
| **Small Payloads** (<1KB)  | None / Custom Dictionary | Compression overhead often increases size for small items. |
| **Large DB Columns**       | Zstd (TOAST)             | Postgres 14+ native support; high speed/low I/O.           |

### Implementation Rules

- **Negotiation**: Always check `Accept-Encoding` header. Order: `zstd` > `br` > `gzip`.
- **Level Selection**: Use Level 3 for dynamic runtime; Level 11 for static build-time.
- **Header Safety**: Ensure `Vary: Accept-Encoding` is set to prevent cache pollution.

## 2. AI Context Compression

Protect the context window by maximizing token density.

### Semantic Summarization

- **Pattern**: Replace raw logs/code with high-density Markdown summaries.
- **Rule**: A summary must preserve **Intent**, **Outcome**, and **Evidence Paths** while removing boilerplate.

### Token Pruning (The "Surgical Cut")

- **Phase 1**: Identify "Dead Context" (e.g., redundant file reads, failed research turns).
- **Phase 2**: Use `/clear` or `/compact` to drop the bottom 50% of the session history.
- **Phase 3**: Re-inject the "State of the Union" summary via Memory MCP.

## 3. Storage Compression (Postgres)

Optimize for cost and performance at the database layer.

- **TOAST Compression**: Set `default_toast_compression = 'zstd'` for large JSONB fields.
- **Blob Compression**: For extremely large blobs (>10MB), compress in the application layer (Node.js `zstd` bindings) before storing as `BYTEA`.

## 4. Verification Checklist

```text
COMPRESSION CHECK
=================
[ ] Static assets pre-compressed with Brotli (Level 11)
[ ] API middleware supports Zstd with Gzip fallback
[ ] Vary: Accept-Encoding header present
[ ] AI context summary preserves Evidence Paths
[ ] redundant research/file reads pruned from session
[ ] DB compression matches Postgres version (Zstd if 14+)
[ ] Payloads < 1KB skip compression to avoid overhead
```

## Verification

After applying this skill, verify:

- [ ] Algorithm matches data type per the decision tree (static=Brotli, dynamic API=Zstd, DB=TOAST Zstd)
- [ ] `Accept-Encoding` negotiation respects the `zstd > br > gzip` priority order
- [ ] `Vary: Accept-Encoding` header is set to prevent cache pollution
- [ ] Small payloads (<1KB) are not compressed (overhead exceeds savings)
- [ ] Context summaries preserve Intent, Outcome, and Evidence Paths
- [ ] Token pruning removes dead context (failed research turns, redundant reads) before injecting fresh state
