# Skill Router

## Coverage

- Routing by keyword pattern: matching inbound query terms to skill `keywords` arrays to identify the best candidate
- Routing by trigger label: matching explicit skill-router labels (`triggers` field) to eliminate ambiguity when the intent is declared
- Routing by file path: matching touched or mentioned file paths against skill `paths` arrays for file-activated skills
- Fallback ordering: how to rank skills when multiple candidates score equally, including `scope` and `type` tiebreakers
- Coverage gaps: detecting when no skill matches a request and how to surface that gap as an authoring signal

## Philosophy

Routing is adversarial against convenience. The tempting move — "if nothing matches exactly, just pick the closest skill and activate it" — is the one that silently degrades every agent that depends on the router. A wrong skill that activates confidently is worse than a coverage gap that surfaces loudly, because silent wrongness has no signal for anyone to fix. The router's job is to produce either a certain winner or an explicit non-answer, never a confident guess.

Four principles follow from that stance:

- **First unique winner stops the chain.** A match on `triggers` is stronger than a match on `paths`, which is stronger than a match on `keywords`. Evaluate surfaces in priority order and stop at the first one that yields a unique winner — do not second-guess a trigger-label hit with keyword analysis.
- **Tiebreakers favor specificity, not popularity.** When scores tie, a skill specific to *this* codebase (`scope: codebase`) wins over a portable skill, and a procedural skill (`type: workflow`) wins over a reference (`type: capability`) because the inbound query is more likely to need action than lookup. Never rank by skill age, usage count, or author preference.
- **Explicit coverage gaps beat silent wrong fallback.** If no surface produces a winner, surface the gap to the caller — recommend authoring a new skill or broadening a keyword list. Silent fallback to a default skill is a bug that no test catches, because the misrouted query looks successful to the router but nonsensical to the downstream agent.
- **The router is a mapping, not a judge.** It decides which skill owns a query; it does not decide whether the query is well-formed, worth handling, or strategically important. Those are the activated skill's concerns. Overloading the router with domain judgment makes it harder to audit and harder to change.

## Routing Rules

The router evaluates three matching surfaces in priority order. The first surface that produces a unique winner stops the evaluation chain.

| Priority | Surface | Field consulted | Match rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Trigger label | `triggers` | Exact match against the declared label. Winner is unambiguous. |
| 2 | File path | `paths` | Glob match against the touched/mentioned path. Prefer the most specific match. |
| 3 | Keyword pattern | `keywords` | Token overlap between query terms and skill keyword list. Rank by match count; break ties with `scope` then `type`. |

### Scope tiebreaker

When keyword scores are equal, prefer skills in this `scope` order: `codebase` > `reference` > `portable`. A codebase-scoped skill is specific to *this* repository and wins over a portable one when both match the query equally.

> **Schema version note.** The v1 enum values `operational` and `generic` were renamed to `codebase` and `portable` in `schema_version: 2`. Always use the v2 names; the current schema rejects the v1 names as hard errors. A full rename map ships with the Skill Graph schema migration notes — consult those when porting a v1 skill.

### Type tiebreaker

After scope, prefer `workflow` over `capability` over `router` over `overlay`. A workflow skill ships procedural decision logic that is usually more actionable than a pure capability reference when the query is ambiguous.

### Fallback behavior

If no skill matches any surface, the router does not fall back to a default skill. It surfaces a coverage gap and recommends authoring a new skill or broadening an existing skill's `keywords` array. Silent fallback to a wrong skill is worse than an explicit coverage-gap signal.

## Evals

This skill ships a comprehension-eval artifact as `skill-router.json` in the Skill Graph `examples/evals/` directory. The eval prompts specifically test the priority-ordered match surfaces, the scope/type tiebreakers, and the explicit refusal to fall back to a default. The eval file is how this skill is graded by the Skill Graph audit runner — consumers in other agent runtimes can treat the eval cases as conformance tests translated to their own grading harness.

## Do NOT Use When

| Use instead | When |
|---|---|
| The target skill directly | The correct skill is already known — skip the router and load it |
| `documentation` | The task is writing or structuring doc prose, not routing |
| `graph-audit` | The task is auditing whether routing metadata is consistent, not dispatching a query |
| `examples/skill-metadata-template.md` | The task is authoring a new skill from scratch, not dispatching to an existing one (the template is a reference artifact, not a routable skill) |
